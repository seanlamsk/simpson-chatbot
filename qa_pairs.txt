Mr. Bergstrom left today.++++@++++Oh.
He's gone. Forever.++++@++++And?
I didn't think you'd understand.++++@++++Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!++++@++++Me?
Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!++++@++++I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her.++++@++++Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy.++++@++++Go Away.
No!++++@++++Nuts.
Look, if you just want me to forgive you --++++@++++No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
That was our wedding.++++@++++Oh.
Children, it's time for you to go to bed.++++@++++It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?
Yeah.++++@++++I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
You're so silly.++++@++++Gimme a banana.
I don't have any banana.++++@++++Come on, you're holding out on me.
I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad.++++@++++Think nothing of it.
Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted...++++@++++Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
No.++++@++++Would you have to do extra work?
Well, no.++++@++++So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto.
Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.++++@++++Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homie, did you straighten everything out...?++++@++++Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
Homer! You promised!++++@++++I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.++++@++++Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
Oh! They're here! How does everything look?++++@++++How do I look?
Do we have enough glasses?++++@++++Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Homer! Homer! Put a record on!++++@++++What are all our friends names again?
Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?++++@++++Why not? I paid for it.
Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor.++++@++++Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?++++@++++No.
Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.++++@++++Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?
Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.++++@++++It was me! You fell for it!
Please Dad.++++@++++You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
What?++++@++++You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
Yes sir.++++@++++Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
Oh, Homer, you're the king!++++@++++I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve.
Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago.++++@++++You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Uh, gee Homer, don't quit...++++@++++All right then.
Oh sure.++++@++++Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
I have never been so embarrassed in my life.++++@++++Why? What'd you do?
Come here!++++@++++Where-where are we going?
Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?++++@++++The way I acted?
Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!++++@++++I put it there.
You did?++++@++++I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!++++@++++I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.
I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.++++@++++No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?
I understand why. You were wasted.++++@++++I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.++++@++++Aw.
Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "Bible Bafflers", "Satan's Boners," "Good Grief! More Satan's Boners" and, for the teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."++++@++++Marge, Marge.
I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?++++@++++Sorry, Reverend.
... or those just in need of a tune-up.++++@++++Hmmmm.
Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?++++@++++Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.
Now you wanna go?++++@++++They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?++++@++++Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth.
Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.++++@++++No, you don't!
Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it.++++@++++Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
Where ya headed?++++@++++Catfish Lake.
Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?++++@++++Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?
He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...++++@++++Oh yeah.
... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.++++@++++Whoa, who says that?
They do.++++@++++Oh.
Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though.++++@++++Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?++++@++++None of your business, Flanders.
Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that.++++@++++Oh.
We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.++++@++++I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers.++++@++++Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Homer, why are you here?++++@++++Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress.
No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?++++@++++She's perfect.
Come on, Homer. What are her faults?++++@++++Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn.++++@++++I'm done.
He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes...++++@++++It's true. It's all true.
Homer, don't interrupt.++++@++++Sorry.
He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...++++@++++I only did that a couple of times.
Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?++++@++++Would this be a good time to be honest?
Yes.++++@++++You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?
Get back in bed.++++@++++No.
We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe....++++@++++Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.
To who?++++@++++To those weirdos in the worm store.
All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.++++@++++Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.
Oh yeah, sure.++++@++++Watch.
How's your marriage?++++@++++Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Ohhh.++++@++++I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
Homer!++++@++++I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!
All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!++++@++++All right, what are you getting at?
I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.++++@++++A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?
Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world.++++@++++Well, t.s.
Okay.++++@++++Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!
Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.++++@++++Bart! What are you staring at?
He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever...++++@++++Bart! Stop it!
So long, officers. Uh-oh.++++@++++Hey, what's all the --
Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her...++++@++++What's the problem, boy?
I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents.++++@++++Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
Really?++++@++++Nah.
Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps.++++@++++Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out.
Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?++++@++++They're fine.
Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do.++++@++++Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.
I don't wanna.++++@++++I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.
You know, Homer, I am your supervisor.++++@++++Sorry, sir.
It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap.++++@++++Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
A-Positive.++++@++++Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.
Sixteen permanent, eight baby.++++@++++Earmuffs.
Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?++++@++++Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.
Bart does.++++@++++Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!
Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know.++++@++++Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.
Is it a Bible story?++++@++++Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.
How did a lion get rich?++++@++++It was the olden days!
Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude.++++@++++Now let's get the show on the road.
Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first.++++@++++Eh.... the boy.
Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?++++@++++Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
Yes, Dad.++++@++++It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.
The meaning of what?++++@++++"Better half," Marge. "Better half."
Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.++++@++++Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!++++@++++Bart!
We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.++++@++++I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter.
You stink.++++@++++Good. "You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
An elephant's butt?++++@++++An elephant's butt.
But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?++++@++++Yup!
You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?++++@++++Forget it, Marge!
Please, Homie? For me?++++@++++Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works.
Homer... Breakfast is ready.++++@++++Hmmm...
Oh... thank you.++++@++++Where's the letter?
Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.++++@++++Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!
Yup.++++@++++All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?
The last place I saw it...++++@++++Uh huh.
...was in my hand...++++@++++Yeah...
...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.++++@++++Why did you do that?
Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I...++++@++++I'll show you mad in the morning.
Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself.++++@++++She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!
Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight.++++@++++Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy.
Why the hose, Homer?++++@++++What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?++++@++++So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: "Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo." Big loss.
Dad, the mailman is here.++++@++++That's a good one. We'll use that.
Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?++++@++++Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?
That's right.++++@++++Well, I'm still gonna run!
Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?++++@++++I don't know.
Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron.++++@++++Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.
Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?++++@++++Homer Simpson.
"...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..." "...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"++++@++++Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?
Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do.++++@++++Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means.
What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.++++@++++I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.
Wait, Dad, he's smiling.++++@++++Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.
It's to open the crate, stupid.++++@++++What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec.++++@++++Marge, what does it do?
It doesn't do anything.++++@++++Marge! Really, what does it do?
Sir, you're my god of generosity.++++@++++Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock.
Well then, I guess the moral is, "No good deed goes unrewarded."++++@++++Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!
Perhaps there is no moral to this story.++++@++++Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
But it certainly was a memorable few days!++++@++++Amen to that!
I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.++++@++++Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
I washed it.++++@++++Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?
Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts.++++@++++Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!++++@++++You! You did this to me!
It has pink frosting!++++@++++Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --
Let's go, Pinky.++++@++++You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the "Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test." Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is.++++@++++Print name?
Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you.++++@++++All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it.
Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote.++++@++++O-kay.
Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --++++@++++No deal.
Dad, maybe you should do this.++++@++++Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?
Dog on Fire. Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?++++@++++Look at him!
And finally, "Baby With A Nail Gun."++++@++++Awww.
Okay, it's time to cast your votes now.++++@++++Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
Hey, Dad. "Do you hear voices?"++++@++++Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV.
Yes. "Are you quick to anger?"++++@++++Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
Right...++++@++++That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
Good...++++@++++Arrghh!
Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.++++@++++Who are you?
Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons.++++@++++I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons.
I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.++++@++++Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?
Michael Jackson.++++@++++Doesn't ring a bell.
Thriller?++++@++++What was that last one?
Thriller.++++@++++Nope.
Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE!++++@++++Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
The moonwalk?++++@++++No, that thing with your feet.
You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?++++@++++Because I wore a pink shirt.
I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.++++@++++What'd you wear?
One white glove, covered with rhinestones.++++@++++Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that.++++@++++Okay. Five times nine.
Forty-five.++++@++++Wowww.
We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle.++++@++++Hey, Chief.
Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me.++++@++++Gee, I gotta call my family.
I could call them for you.++++@++++Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.
Hmmmm, lobotomy...++++@++++That's all right, son.
Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty.++++@++++What's that?
What's wrong, Homer?++++@++++This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared.
HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME.++++@++++Pancakes... football... Boobies...
Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't.++++@++++Was the door locked?
No, I just couldn't face what was out there.++++@++++Was it raining?
Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work.++++@++++Were you out of gas?
You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord!++++@++++Mmm... pancakes.
Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others.++++@++++That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?
Of course.++++@++++Not insane.
I'm proud of you, Homer.++++@++++Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily.++++@++++You are? Why?
Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose.++++@++++Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.
Um Homer, I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink.++++@++++Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital.++++@++++Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Huh?++++@++++Huh? Huh?
I thought so. Oh, Bart, you...++++@++++Come off. I'm sane now.
This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy?++++@++++Not me. I got this.
Mr. Simpson, I can assure you this "check" of yours is non-negotiable.++++@++++Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?
You see where it says "VOID-VOID-VOID" and "This Is Not A Check"? "Cash value one twentieth of a cent"? "Mr. Banker, do not honor."++++@++++Shut up.
Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest.++++@++++Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now.
No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men.++++@++++Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.
Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin', it's lunchtime.++++@++++Nah, you go ahead.
Hey, You don't wanna eat? What'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?++++@++++As Tolstoy said in "Quotable Notables," "Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."
But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear.++++@++++Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.
Important.++++@++++Ooh... How about the "V"?
Hey, what gives, man?++++@++++We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.++++@++++Don't be so...
Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...++++@++++Hmph?
I thought you might want to snuggle.++++@++++That reminds me! "Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."
Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?++++@++++Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
It certainly has enriched our lives.++++@++++Wow! "Win a Trip to Washington D.C."! "All expenses paid... VIP tour"... Oh. It's for kids.
Very.++++@++++Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad.++++@++++Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.
"So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car. Oh yes, and don't forget to burn your house. Because none of those things could exist without six white stripes, seven red stripes, and a hell of a lotta stars." Thank you very much.++++@++++YEAH! Damn right!
Are you a professional writer?++++@++++Uh-uh.
Lisa, after meeting your father, I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington!++++@++++Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
Yes, sir. Can I get you something?++++@++++Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me.
Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS.++++@++++BOOOOO!
Homer, look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow.++++@++++Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
MOMMM!++++@++++Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.
Good morning. This is your wake-up call.++++@++++Wake-up call? It's two AM!
Sorry fatso.++++@++++Free food?!
Lisa? I'm Faith Crowley, Patriotism Editor of Reading Digest.++++@++++Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is "How To Increase Your Word Power." That thing is really, really, really good.
These are special VIP badges. They'll get you into places other tourists never see.++++@++++Miss? What does the "I" stand for?
"On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to back-300 games."++++@++++Yeah, right.
Folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. Oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don't give out free samples.++++@++++Lousy cheap country...
I'm too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial?++++@++++Who's that?
Thank you!++++@++++Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you...
Lisa, what's gotten into you?++++@++++Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'.
Extra! Extra! Feds nab rotten Rep!++++@++++Gimme one of those!
Miss Crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. I would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. Particularly the courageous Lisa Simpson, whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.++++@++++Give her the check!
Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!++++@++++I'm almost done.
You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!++++@++++I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.
I think it means he's having a barbecue.++++@++++Well, why doesn't he just say so?
He's trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance --++++@++++Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story.
We can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --++++@++++Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place.
Oh, Homer.++++@++++Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club...
And so the Saskatchewan Rough Riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, Jack, get the kicker they so sorely need...++++@++++Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave.
You lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.++++@++++The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
Friends, we love you all, but I also have a "sinister" motive for asking you all here -- "sinister" being Latin for "left-handed." But enough joking.++++@++++That was a joke?
So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?++++@++++Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too.++++@++++Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?
Oh, here, you two. Make a wish.++++@++++Nah.
It's fun.++++@++++No, it isn't.
You must have something you want to wish for, Homer.++++@++++Hmm, let's see.
Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!++++@++++Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!
No, no, no, don't say. Otherwise it won't come true.++++@++++Oooh. That would be a shame.
Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?++++@++++Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.
That sounds fine, Bart.++++@++++See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology.
Absotively posilutely.++++@++++So, Flanders, have you sold anything?
Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?++++@++++No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know.
It's the German term for "shameful joy" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others.++++@++++Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?
Sour grapes.++++@++++Boy, those Germans have a word for everything.
So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today?++++@++++Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.
Uh, I learned the touch of death.++++@++++Ooh, the touch of death.
All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady.++++@++++Hey, boy. How was class?
Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.++++@++++Oh, that'll learn 'im.
Pinking shears? Let's go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes.++++@++++Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?
Hey Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?++++@++++Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?++++@++++Uh, well actually, Moe...
Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?++++@++++Homer Simpson, sir.
Oh! It's a real one! "No more apples in the vending machine, please." Well, that's almost a sentence!++++@++++Can I leave, Mr. Burns?
Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples.++++@++++But the note was asking you to --
Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!++++@++++Um, Mr. Burns...
Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here.++++@++++Sorry, Flanders.
Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind.++++@++++Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?++++@++++Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!
Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut.++++@++++I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.++++@++++You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it.
Oh, Homer, be reasonable.++++@++++Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
All right, Homer.++++@++++Twenty dollars?
Twenty dollars.++++@++++Now I don't want it.
Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly.++++@++++Daddly-doodly.
Homer, this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?++++@++++Only seventy-five beans!
Good afternoon, sir, I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills.++++@++++Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many.
Oh.++++@++++Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
Damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...++++@++++Uh, there's a store where...
Hey, you said you're Homer Simpson?++++@++++Yeah.
Homer! Over here!++++@++++Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back.
Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up.++++@++++You're gonna live in your car?
Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined.++++@++++I know!
You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now.++++@++++Why not?
I sold it to you for seven cents.++++@++++Oh.
You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me.++++@++++Oh, it's all my fault.
No it's not.++++@++++Yes it is.
No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend.++++@++++No, I was a swine.
For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.++++@++++Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!
Oh, Homer, there's no point...++++@++++I SAID DO IT!
Hurry, Neddie, hurry! Oh golly, it's a miracle!++++@++++C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?
Homer?++++@++++It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right.
Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends.++++@++++To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart.++++@++++Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!
Hey, that's my badge, Homer.++++@++++That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh.
Bart, your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something.++++@++++How much does it pay?
Thirty bucks a week.++++@++++Pfft. I make more than that.
Good for you, Chief.++++@++++... Bart! Have you started smoking?
They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.++++@++++Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn...
Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated.++++@++++Son, I'll never doubt you again.
The kiss of death. That's all I need!++++@++++A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal.
Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?++++@++++Oh, all right.
I am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.++++@++++You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter.
Homer, what did you find out?++++@++++Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.
Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys.++++@++++Wait till I get you home, boy.
Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?++++@++++Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit.
Principal Skinner!++++@++++I thought he was dead.
To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.++++@++++Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple.
Cool!++++@++++Hey, when do we get the check for this?
Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us.++++@++++You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King.++++@++++Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.
Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.++++@++++What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
Five minutes before critical mass.++++@++++Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it.
One minute to core meltdown.++++@++++Shut up!
Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer...++++@++++Yes.
Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button.++++@++++Ooh, a side.
Simpson?++++@++++What?
Do you see which button I'm pushing?++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it.
Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.++++@++++Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe.
Yeah, we owe you one.++++@++++Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button.
And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin "Magic" Johnson.++++@++++Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
Is this really Homer Simpson?++++@++++Yeah.
Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust.++++@++++Well, thank you.
I don't care.++++@++++Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?
Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.++++@++++Thanks, Magic.
A role model in my very own home. How convenient.++++@++++Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home.
How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?++++@++++It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
Maybe you ate a clove.++++@++++What's your problem, boy?
I had a fight with Milhouse.++++@++++That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
How Zen.++++@++++What? What is it? What are you doing?
Looking at you with quiet awe.++++@++++Well, as long as it's quiet.
Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility.++++@++++Huh? Wha?...
They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!++++@++++Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.++++@++++But I really can't tell them anything, sir.
He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on "How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."++++@++++What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.++++@++++Did it work?
Poor guy.++++@++++Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
Just picture them in their underwear.++++@++++Um, Grace under pressure is no...
Three minutes to meltdown.++++@++++Whew! Saved by the bell.
Just do what you did before.++++@++++All right.
Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed?++++@++++Sure. Moe.
God bless that clown.++++@++++You think it's him?
Krusty, you don't have to be "on" tonight.++++@++++What are you talking about? Of course he does.
Go wait in the car.++++@++++We could have seen a monkey.
Well, alright. I'm a little rusty, but um, I'll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz.++++@++++He's talking funny talk.
No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish.++++@++++A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks.++++@++++Mel Brooks is Jewish?
Yes, it's just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. The old days... my... my father...++++@++++Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?
Come on...++++@++++Yeah, Krusty, tell us.
Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you.++++@++++Why you little...
Do you have any yearbooks?++++@++++No, that's it. You've seen everything.
Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.++++@++++Gladly.
And, to conclude this Halloween newscast on a scary note, remember: The presidential primaries are only a few months away.++++@++++Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia.
Trick or treat, man.++++@++++Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes.
Hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house back to the stone age.++++@++++Here you go, kids. Lousy punks...
We're home!++++@++++Get a good haul this year?
Heh heh heh...Jackpot!++++@++++I am very, very proud of you kids.
Oh yeah, three bad nightmares.++++@++++I'd like to see that.
I can do that but I don't wanna.++++@++++Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Allal ben Abdallah. It has the power to grant wishes to its owner.++++@++++Oh yeah? How much?
Sir, I must strongly advise you do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I myself was once President of Algeria...++++@++++C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!
Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?++++@++++Why at that little shop, right over... there.
You must pay a fine of two American dollars.++++@++++Okay.
Peace on Earth.++++@++++Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish.
Homer, there's something I don't like about that severed hand.++++@++++Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.
Oh, my land!++++@++++Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie.
Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous.++++@++++Now you're talkin'!
Yaaayyy!!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Oh Homer, this is awful.++++@++++Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful.
I wish for world peace.++++@++++Lisa, that was very selfish of you.
Jeez, now we're slaves. This paw sucks.++++@++++Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?
Hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?++++@++++Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead.++++@++++I wish I had a Monkey's Paw.
Good morning, dear.++++@++++Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.
Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire!++++@++++It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good.
I want to watch Krusty.++++@++++Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.
Yayy!++++@++++Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh.
Homer, I see you agree with my theory.++++@++++I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.++++@++++Ouch!
Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you.++++@++++Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.
You got it.++++@++++Oh, ah, thanks boy.
I love you, dad.++++@++++I love you, son.
Can we sleep with you?++++@++++You both toilet-trained?
Yes!++++@++++Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work.
Attention Homer Simpson. Attention Homer Simpson. Wake up, Homer.++++@++++Huh? What?
You're fired.++++@++++For what?
For sleeping on the job.++++@++++How do you know I was sleeping?
We've been watching you on the surveillance camera.++++@++++Camera?
Hey, here's a good job, Dad. Oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor.++++@++++How hard can it be?
Hey, Dad. Here's one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people.++++@++++Ooo, what job is that?
Deeper. Wider. Faster. I wouldn't bury me turtle in that mud puddle. Ah, what's the use?++++@++++Sheesh. What a slave driver.
Did you have a nightmare, Homie?++++@++++No. Bart bit me.
Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.++++@++++I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.++++@++++I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
Don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner.++++@++++Umm. Spaghetti.
But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands.++++@++++Oh, I hate having two heads.
Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show.++++@++++Don't worry, I know it's tonight.
No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one.++++@++++Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.++++@++++Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
Why don't you go there first?++++@++++Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?
Sorry, Homer.++++@++++You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.
What's the matter, buddy?++++@++++The moron next door closed early!
I happen to be that moron.++++@++++Oh, me and my trenchant mouth.
Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year.++++@++++Hmm. "Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!" Yes! That's it!
Let me think about it... Eh... No.++++@++++Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one.
Okay. Okay. But now we're even. So what does your daughter need?++++@++++I'll have you know, I wrote it down.
Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?++++@++++I dunno.
Clarinet?++++@++++No.
Oboe?++++@++++No.
Saxophone?++++@++++No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?
Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.++++@++++Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache?++++@++++I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
I'm done.++++@++++That cost eighty-eight dollars!
I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating.++++@++++Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I forgive you.++++@++++You didn't mean that!
Did you hear that, Homer?++++@++++No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.
Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her.++++@++++Okay.
Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.++++@++++Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
We can't afford to buy a pony.++++@++++Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.
That's ridiculous.++++@++++Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.
That's no reason to buy a pony!++++@++++See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes.
Stick to the subject.++++@++++Ha ha, you love me.
Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't.++++@++++Mm.
What was that? Was that a yes or a no?++++@++++Buh.
Those aren't even words!++++@++++Sneh.
Oh, it's you.++++@++++Excuse me, do you sell ponies?
Uh, sure pal, right here.++++@++++"Scot-tish deer-hound." Hey, this is a dog!
Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.++++@++++Half a million dollars?!
He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby.++++@++++Wow!
His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania...++++@++++I'll take it!
Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars?++++@++++Uh, sure... let me write you a check.
Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054.++++@++++Is there a problem with that?
Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash.++++@++++Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
Simpson, eh? How can I help you?++++@++++Mr. Burns, you do this personally?
It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?++++@++++U-su-ry?
Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan?++++@++++I want to buy a pony.
Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it?++++@++++No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
Shut up, Simpson.++++@++++Sorry.
Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?++++@++++Of course.
I am very upset with you.++++@++++Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?++++@++++Because she stopped loving me.
I don't love you either. So give me a moped.++++@++++I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?++++@++++I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
That's illegal.++++@++++That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me.
Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable.++++@++++Stable? That sounds expensive.
Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived.++++@++++Oh nuts.
Wait, Dad, I've got something for you.++++@++++I was hoping it'd be money.
Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.++++@++++Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.
Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer.++++@++++Nah, we're not gonna be doing that.
Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.++++@++++First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind.
Homer...++++@++++Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays.
All right. You got us into this, you get us out.++++@++++Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it.
Here you go.++++@++++Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu.
Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer!++++@++++Thank you.
If I could just see the ticket...++++@++++There it is.
Please to be removing your thumb.++++@++++No.
Yes. Please, I must insist...++++@++++No! No!
I've got to look at the ticket++++@++++No! You can't see... come on!
Yes, I must...++++@++++No!
A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?++++@++++Ohh... I need money.
Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my "Help Wanted" sign.++++@++++You're looking for help?
Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift.++++@++++I'm your man!
You're hired.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.++++@++++...Badge of honor.
Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There's only one bozo who comes in and buys them.++++@++++But I eat... Oh.
Homer, where have you been? I was so worried.++++@++++Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it.
Oh my God, she killed him.++++@++++Mmm... salty.
Homer, are you stealing Squishees?++++@++++No sir.
Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.++++@++++Yes sir.
Homie, how long do you plan to do this?++++@++++I don't know. How long do horses live?
I just called to say I love you, Dad.++++@++++Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
Hey, Homer, where ya goin'?++++@++++Going for... eight hour walk.
Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today.++++@++++Coming right up, sir.
And fill it to the top this time.++++@++++Yes, sir.
Dad, you don't have to do this.++++@++++Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money...
Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony.++++@++++You did?
Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse.++++@++++Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!
I mean you, you dummy.++++@++++Awww.
Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube...++++@++++That baby changed our lives.
Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.++++@++++Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?++++@++++In the garage.
I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.++++@++++Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.++++@++++If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.++++@++++Okay, okay, calm down.
Homer, be nice.++++@++++Okay, I will. I will.
No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore.++++@++++... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah.
Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?++++@++++Shh! They'll hear you.
Who's using the power tools?++++@++++I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Everything.++++@++++What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?
Uh... take us to the video store.++++@++++Anything for my little girl.
You want to rent it, sir?++++@++++Why? I just saw the best part.
But, Dad, I can't find "Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town".++++@++++Just grab something. All these movies are great.
Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take.++++@++++Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman.
This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.++++@++++Oh Marge.
Question one: "Name one of your child's friends..."++++@++++Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
They want a name, Homer, not a vague description.++++@++++Okay. Hank.
Hank?! Hank who?++++@++++Hank... Jones.
Homer, you made that up. Question two: "Who is your son's hero?"++++@++++Steve McQueen.
That's your hero. "Name another dad you talked to about parenting."++++@++++Next.
What are your son's hobbies?++++@++++Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
He hasn't done that since he was two.++++@++++Then he has no hobbies.
Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.++++@++++Bart!... BART!!!
No, not really.++++@++++Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Building a Soap Box Derby racer.++++@++++Oh, that's a hobby!
Hey, so it is.++++@++++Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!
You're also fat.++++@++++I'm also fat!
National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking.++++@++++I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel.++++@++++Goodbye, son.
For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of "Fatherhood" by Bill Cosby.++++@++++Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.
Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.++++@++++Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?
Homer, meet Dave Jr.++++@++++Huh?
Thanks, Dad.++++@++++Oh, how I envy you!
Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort.++++@++++I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?++++@++++What boy?
Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.++++@++++Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?++++@++++Okay. No, I'm gonna do it.
Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help.++++@++++But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Come on Dad, it'd be weird.++++@++++Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.++++@++++Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!
Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile?++++@++++Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
You didn't hear nothin'.++++@++++Are you nervous son?
Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...++++@++++Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson.
Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.++++@++++When did I ever teach you that?
Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but...++++@++++Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad.
Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?++++@++++Why? What's wrong?
Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.++++@++++Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?
Tell me something I don't know.++++@++++Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!
Dad, aren't you coming?++++@++++No!
Now, don't pout.++++@++++I'm not pouting, you are.
Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge.++++@++++Sorry.
Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?++++@++++No. Can't think of a thing.
But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.++++@++++Leave me alone.
In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns.++++@++++Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... "Name your child's friends." Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? "Who is your son's heroe?"...
Hey ho Simpson.++++@++++Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
Well sir, there are two schools of thought...++++@++++Great, thanks.
Forget about your father. You're driving for me now!++++@++++Do it for your old man, boy!
Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!++++@++++That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!
...We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man...++++@++++He's not so fat.
Whoa, T and A.++++@++++Bart, why are you still up?
Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?++++@++++Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego.
Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!++++@++++What is it, boy?
Ow! What was that for?++++@++++You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh.
There he is! Let's give him a make-over.++++@++++Run for it boy!
Come here, Maggie.++++@++++That's it. I'm outta here.
Hiya, Homer.++++@++++What's the matter, Moe?
Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.++++@++++Yeah, things are tough all over.
Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.++++@++++Could I get a beer?
Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?++++@++++Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...
Aye carumba!++++@++++As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.
They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom.++++@++++I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.
Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?++++@++++A "Flaming Homer".
Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of "Flaming Homers"?++++@++++Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
It's not without its charm.++++@++++Try lighting it on fire.
Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?++++@++++Well, it's called a "Flaming...
I'll be back.++++@++++Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?
Pardon me, are you the genius behind the "Flaming Moe"?++++@++++Why yes I --
Honey, what's wrong?++++@++++I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
Can I help you sir?++++@++++I need to talk to Moe.
Your name's not on the list.++++@++++I didn't even tell you my name.
Okay, what's your name?++++@++++Homer Simpson.
Not on the list.++++@++++But--
AND I TALK TO MY DAD, HE SAY/ HE SAID, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' TILL YOU'RE DOWN ON A MUFFIN AND YOU'RE SURE TO BE CHANGIN' YOUR WAYS/ I MET A CHEERLEADER WAS A REAL YOUNG BLEEDER OH THE TIMES I COULD REMINISCE/ TO THE BEST THINGS OF LOVIN' WITH HER SISTER AND HER COUSIN AND THEY STARTED WITH A LITTLE KISS/++++@++++Barney?
Hiya, Scrumptious. Do you want to ignite my drink?++++@++++You're my kid's teacher!
Single parent, are we?++++@++++No!
Well, let's pretend you are.++++@++++Get away from me.
Oh, hiya, Homer. How 'bout a beer?++++@++++I'd rather have a "Flaming Homer".
A what? Oh, I get it.++++@++++How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it.
Homer, I'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. This is business.++++@++++Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!
What? I'm sorry. Homer, I couldn't hear you.++++@++++I said, you just lost yourself a customer!
Homer, you're gonna have to speak up!++++@++++You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!
I lost myself to what?++++@++++You just lost yourself a customer.
Homer, I'll talk to you tomorrow.++++@++++You just lost yourself a customer.
Yeah, what do you want?!++++@++++A beer?
Okay, then.++++@++++Can I have a clean glass?
Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.++++@++++Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!
I moe, I moe.++++@++++Moe... Moe... Moe.
Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.++++@++++Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe...
What the...++++@++++Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, "How does he do it?" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is...
Homer, no!++++@++++Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!
Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here.++++@++++Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.++++@++++I guess so.
Compliments of the house. One "Flaming Homer".++++@++++Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.
I'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir.++++@++++It's not fair!
I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed.++++@++++Uh-huh.
People think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars.++++@++++Ooh, that's a lot of money.
Good, good. Try to eat something.++++@++++Homer Simpson here.
Homer, it's your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years.++++@++++I own stock?
Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights.++++@++++So uh, how much did it go up?
Wait a minute. Let's not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive?++++@++++Yeah...
Like any sports?++++@++++Sure...
Ever go dancing?++++@++++Not any more...
We should get together sometime.++++@++++That'd be great.
There. Now we trust each other.++++@++++Well... how are you?
Near death. I'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.++++@++++Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
Twenty five cents a share.++++@++++What should I do?
Well, let me put it this way. You'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now.++++@++++Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?++++@++++No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve.
Yeah, but thank you anyway.++++@++++Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?++++@++++Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.
We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on.++++@++++Hey... hey!
Oh, Homer!++++@++++You heard?
We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.++++@++++Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.
What do you mean?++++@++++I spent it on beer.
You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?++++@++++Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
Hey, Homer.++++@++++Did you buy this car with your stock money?
Ich bin ein Springfielder!++++@++++We could all lose our jobs.
Well, they can't fire me. I'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier.++++@++++Well, they can't fire me.
Why?++++@++++Cuz... I...
You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay.++++@++++Lucky drunks.
We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.++++@++++Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!
One of the economic powers of the world--++++@++++Because we send them money?
Homie, come to bed.++++@++++Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it.
Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow.++++@++++Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing.
Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?++++@++++Ooh, Battlestar Galactica.
Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work.++++@++++Huh? What?
Homer, could we have a word with you?++++@++++No.
I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?++++@++++No!
You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?++++@++++Uh... all of them?
I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.++++@++++I sure do!
Such as...++++@++++Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy.
We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate.++++@++++Mmm. The land of chocolate...
Mr. Simpson...++++@++++La la la la la la...
That was ten minutes ago!++++@++++I think I did pretty good in there.
I want you to take baths, Bart.++++@++++Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing.
Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my "buddy" here.++++@++++I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.++++@++++That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Why, no.++++@++++And does it ever say, "I love you?"
No, it doesn't.++++@++++Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!
That was no accident. Let's get out of here.++++@++++Na na na na / Na na na na /
"Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test"? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?++++@++++But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.
Okay, let's see... "Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be".++++@++++Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?
"If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail". Well, I guess I'd better go see Dr. Hibbert.++++@++++Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?
Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids.++++@++++Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get.
Is anything wrong?++++@++++No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg.
Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad?++++@++++Maybe.
Ohhh, cool, we can race them.++++@++++Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.
Doesn't Mom do that stuff?++++@++++Yeah, but I have to hear about it.
Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?++++@++++Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.
Hmmm, what do you think about?++++@++++Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!
That's better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters.++++@++++Yes, sir.
It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV.++++@++++Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh...
Homer, do you ever think about the future?++++@++++You mean like will apes be our masters?
No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.++++@++++But it gives me time to think.
I think about you, too.++++@++++Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father.
Our song.++++@++++I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
Actually, she was singing about God.++++@++++Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad.
You don't have to do that.++++@++++Phew, good.
Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy.++++@++++Really? It must be the Champale talking.
What if we get caught?++++@++++Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer.++++@++++Why? What's wrong?
Well, that unforgettable night we... joined the Castle Club...++++@++++Oh.
Son, you gotta marry that girl!++++@++++Because it's the honorable thing to do?
Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?++++@++++Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?
What card?++++@++++Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.
Is this it?++++@++++What's it say?
"Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?"++++@++++That's the card. Give it here.
Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!++++@++++So... will you marry me?
Kool Moe Dee.++++@++++You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.
Homer, I've been thinking. If the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name Larry?++++@++++Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy.
Well, how about Louie?++++@++++They'll call him Screwy Louie.
Bob?++++@++++Slob.
Luke?++++@++++Puke.
Marcus?++++@++++Mucous.
What about Bart?++++@++++Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!
Yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?++++@++++I don't know.
Be sure to get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house.++++@++++Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.++++@++++Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place.
Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband.++++@++++I am?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join...++++@++++Homer.
Homer, same question, names reversed.++++@++++I do.
What a perfect day.++++@++++Our first night together as man and wife.
Homer, I don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary.++++@++++Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well.
I don't know. I heard radiation can make you sterile.++++@++++Pfft. Now you tell me.
I push myself too hard.++++@++++Dear Marge, XXX. Homer.
Okay, that'll do.++++@++++... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
That's enough! Next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?++++@++++There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!
Did you get the job?++++@++++Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life.
Oh, Homie. Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking.++++@++++Wow! Kid, I won't let you down.
... You, gentle sir, are fired!++++@++++Oh!
Oh, hello, young man.++++@++++Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co.
Hey, who wants to get rich today?++++@++++Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!
"Fourth Notice"... "90 Days Overdue"... "We Break Thumbs"... Homer, what are we going to do?++++@++++I don't know, I don't know --
Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.++++@++++"Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."
Shut up with that pen-scratching down there!++++@++++I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
That is so sad.++++@++++Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household.
Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?++++@++++Okay.
Marge, listen... We just saw...++++@++++Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...
That's right. All the colors of the rainbow.++++@++++Wowww.
My husband by my side.++++@++++You want fries with that?
Homer... Come home with me.++++@++++No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.++++@++++Marge, for you.
Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.++++@++++Oh, sure.
Homer, do you know why I married you?++++@++++Because I knocked you up?
Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive.++++@++++You the boss?
I'll call security, sir.++++@++++Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.++++@++++You mean?
Welcome aboard, son.++++@++++I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!
You're a little late. She's gone to the hospital.++++@++++The hospital?
I'll drive you.++++@++++Thanks, mom.
Right where you left it.++++@++++Shut up!
Hey, listen fatboy --++++@++++No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!
Homer, does this mean --++++@++++Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!
Good God.++++@++++And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!
Doesn't your job start tomorrow?++++@++++Eh, somebody'll cover for me.
Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?++++@++++Oh, college boy, eh?
Homie, isn't he beautiful?++++@++++Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.
Homer, I'm not pregnant.++++@++++Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!
Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart a birthday present?++++@++++Mon-ey.
Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars.++++@++++Oh, sorry.
WE'RE GONNA ROLL THIS TRUCKIN' CONVOY / CROSS THE U.S.A. / CON-VOY...++++@++++That could be Bart!
Hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.++++@++++He's in for some lovin'.
You're fired!++++@++++Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.
But order now, supply is limited.++++@++++Limited?!
Ehhh...++++@++++Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!
Fine.++++@++++Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
Here you go. Enjoy.++++@++++Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch.
Quit it, Dad!++++@++++Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!
I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer.++++@++++Mmmmm. Chocolate.
We have captured your president. He was delicious.++++@++++Why, you little...
Uh-huh.++++@++++Aww...
Bart! What's wrong with you?++++@++++Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero.
How do you mean, dad?++++@++++Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...
How does that make him a hero?++++@++++Well, it's more than you did!
So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.++++@++++You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!++++@++++Hey, don't make me come down there!
Like to see you fit.++++@++++Why, you little --
So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.++++@++++It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident.
Mom, it's too big.++++@++++Don't worry, you'll grow into it.
You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair...++++@++++That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself.
Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--++++@++++Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.
Man, I was so scared.++++@++++Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.++++@++++Well, bye-bye belt.
Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart.++++@++++Pfft, my heart is just fine.
But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver.++++@++++Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!
Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.++++@++++Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver.
Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster.++++@++++Twenty big ones on Denver.
Pleasure doing business with you, H. S.++++@++++All right, Denver. Justify my love.
DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.++++@++++Lousy, stupid Denver.
Ho, look at that score. Moxy!++++@++++Why did you do that?
Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?++++@++++Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there.
Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.++++@++++Why didn't you say that before!
I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's "Lock of the Week."++++@++++Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy.
In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my "Shoe-in of the Week".++++@++++Huh, they both make a good case.
You want some of this don't ya?++++@++++Yeah!
You have reached the Coach's hot...++++@++++Line...
line.++++@++++Yeah, lay it on me, coach.
In the game of Mi-a-mi...++++@++++Mm-hm.
...versus Cin-++++@++++Cincinnati...
cin-++++@++++Cincinnati.
nat-++++@++++Cincinnati.
ti...++++@++++C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?
We must consider many things. The wind...++++@++++Doh, not the wind.
...is blowing out of the west...++++@++++Oh...
at five++++@++++... miles per hour.
knots...++++@++++Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?
Touchdown Dolphins!++++@++++All right, Dolphins!
All right, Dolphins!++++@++++Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!++++@++++Fifty big ones!
Fifty big ones?++++@++++Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game.
You mean you made a bet?++++@++++Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting.
What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?++++@++++Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?
See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?++++@++++And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
So gambling makes a good thing even better.++++@++++That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us.
And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10.++++@++++YEAH!
Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.++++@++++You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible.
Really, where?++++@++++Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?
Did you two have fun?++++@++++You bet.
Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today.++++@++++Me too, honey.
Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?++++@++++Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
This team is fired up! We came here to play!++++@++++All right!
He'll lose.++++@++++What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men.++++@++++You think we should bet against them?
I'd bet my entire college fund on it.++++@++++You got it.
Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.++++@++++Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?
Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin' high. Who would have thunk it?++++@++++My daughter, that's who!
Yeah, me!++++@++++Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift.
C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.++++@++++Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.++++@++++Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars.++++@++++I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.
Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.++++@++++Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
Hello, I'm Marco. I'll be your waiter.++++@++++Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer.
Charming lad.++++@++++Oh, violin guy!
The Broken Neck Blues.++++@++++Play on.
Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan.++++@++++Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago.++++@++++Good, good... You call Moe.
Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday?++++@++++Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?
Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is.++++@++++Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's "Versatility."++++@++++Boy, I know you're gonna like your present.
Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from.++++@++++All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.
I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't.++++@++++All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.
I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.++++@++++But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?
But gambling is illegal.++++@++++Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together.
Well, I just don't know.++++@++++Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted.
You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.++++@++++Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.
What about Daddy-Daughter day?++++@++++Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.
I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!++++@++++Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat.
So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer.++++@++++Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me.
Yeah, I did.++++@++++Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?
Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.++++@++++It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.++++@++++Okay.
I think Dallas is a mortal lock.++++@++++Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
However...++++@++++However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?
However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.++++@++++Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: "Daddy should bet all his money on..."
Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you?++++@++++Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here.
Wow!++++@++++Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'.
Dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo's going to start with excellent field position.++++@++++Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!
Whatcha got riding on this game?++++@++++My daughter.
Hey Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you?++++@++++Not Duff Dry... Dallas.
Okay, okay. They're both great teams.++++@++++Huh?
Touchdown Cowboys!++++@++++All right, we're back in business.
So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here's the handoff.++++@++++Please, please, please...
What are you so happy about Homer? You didn't win any money.++++@++++Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!
Come on, Dad!++++@++++It's beautiful.
Isn't it though?++++@++++After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?
Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer....++++@++++Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese...
Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer's dry-cleaning -- I think that's everything.++++@++++Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.
Homer, I'm running late as it is. Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?++++@++++Alley balls?
Where's my lucky red cap?++++@++++Alley balls...
But don't put your lips on it or anything.++++@++++Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?
Homer? Is that you?++++@++++What should I say?
How about, "Yes, it's me".++++@++++Yes it's me!
Tell her you love her.++++@++++I love you very much.
Why don't you just wrap it up?++++@++++Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?
Homer++++@++++Whaa...
I need a vacation.++++@++++What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?
I need to unwind.++++@++++I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. "Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"
No. I mean a vacation by myself.++++@++++What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!
No Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations.++++@++++Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back.
I swear.++++@++++All right then.
Wish I'd thought of that.++++@++++She's startin' to give.
Uh-huh. He'll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine.++++@++++For your information, I can take care of my --
Goodbye, Homie.++++@++++Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?
Check the dryer!++++@++++How often should I change Maggie?
Whenever she needs it.++++@++++Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?
Then just push nine on your phone. Then the pound sign. Then four-eight-three. We'll do the rest.++++@++++C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num.
Hi Homie. I feel much better.++++@++++Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.
No problem. Well, well, if it isn't little Bart. Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey Homer, let me hold him.++++@++++All right, but just be careful.
Oh man, you want a bad night, try sleeping on one of these.++++@++++Barney, I've lost the baby. It's the worst thing I've ever done.
Don't worry, don't worry. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make you an omlette.++++@++++Just help me look!
Are you sure? I make 'em with two kinds of cheese.++++@++++C'mon!
Come on!++++@++++Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
What do you want?++++@++++I came to see the kids.
Wait here. And don't steal any light bulbs.++++@++++Hmmm.
Dad!++++@++++Hey kids... uh... you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you?
Uh-um.++++@++++Well, I gotta go.
Homer, that's awful!++++@++++Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away.
You the man who reported the lost baby?++++@++++Yes.
Can you describe her?++++@++++Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
Bingo!++++@++++Oh Maggie!
Not so fast! You're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.++++@++++You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Hi, did you miss me?++++@++++Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
And from now on I hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.++++@++++You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?
Maybe we should let the dog in?++++@++++Marge, dogs love the outdoors.
I think he needs a dog house.++++@++++Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?
I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.++++@++++Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.
I am not!++++@++++Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house.
Oh, I don't know...++++@++++Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
You've got a date with a xerox machine.++++@++++Stupid lumber...
Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited.++++@++++"Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."
He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure.++++@++++Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!
I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.++++@++++Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?
No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth.++++@++++What the hell are you talking about?
Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys.++++@++++Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache.
What's wrong with my moustache?++++@++++Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?++++@++++Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
Well, you know, maybe he's right.++++@++++Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?
Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --++++@++++Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now.
No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?++++@++++Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar.
Yes, Homer.++++@++++What if I catch on fire?
No, Homer.++++@++++What if I see something really weird in the sky?
Homer, that was a twenty.++++@++++God --
Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.++++@++++You dirty bas...
How's the dog supposed to get in?++++@++++Well, he just goes... Ohhh
Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.++++@++++Where'd you get the money?
There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.++++@++++Maggie. Oh. Cute.
No, behind her.++++@++++Beer! How did you know?
Mrs. Krabappel.++++@++++Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night.
Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing.++++@++++Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her.++++@++++Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.++++@++++Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.++++@++++I may hold you to that, Marge.
"I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."++++@++++Three simple words. I am gay.
Oh, that's very good, Lisa.++++@++++P.S. -- I am gay.
How shall we end it?++++@++++How about, "With a love that will echo through the ages?"
Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper.++++@++++Why you little...
Hey Homer, slow down. You're gonna choke or somethin'.++++@++++Don't tell me how to eat donuts --
Softball starts this week.++++@++++Softball?
Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight.++++@++++Look, I know it wasn't our best season.
Actually, it was.++++@++++Well, this year's gonna be different.
What's that? A home-made bat?++++@++++It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house...
Homer, go back to the garage.++++@++++And here it is.
Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?++++@++++Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you're up. Where's that secret weapon?++++@++++Check it out, boys. My magic bat.
And I got an enchanted jock strap.++++@++++Yeah, just watch.
No, I want to get him a beer.++++@++++Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion.
No, sir! Whom should I kill?++++@++++I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!
One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!++++@++++You're Darryl Strawberry.
So?++++@++++Well, are you better than me?
You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you?++++@++++Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.++++@++++Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.
That's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give.++++@++++I got it! I got it!
Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?++++@++++No.
You heard me, hippie.++++@++++These guys aren't so tough. I've got "Wonder Bat."
Aw, nuts!++++@++++Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?
Oh, Homie. You're good at lots of things.++++@++++Like what?
Like snuggling...++++@++++Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.
To the game.++++@++++No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.
All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up...++++@++++They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me.
You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.++++@++++I am? Whoo-hoo!
If I tug the bill of my cap like so...++++@++++Yes.
...it means the signal is a fake.++++@++++Uh uh.
However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly.++++@++++Got it.
Got that Simpson?++++@++++Yes, sir!
Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson.++++@++++Huh?
We won! We won! All right!++++@++++Lurleen.
Wait till next year. If I'm still alive.++++@++++Good one, Lenny.
Lisa, it's not that bad.++++@++++So what're you gonna be, boy?
That's nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy.++++@++++No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb.
Honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help.++++@++++Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
My God, they are stubby.++++@++++Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it.
No no, sir, we're here to pick up your son. He's coming on a ride-along.++++@++++Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
Bart's grades are up a little this term. But Lisa's are way down.++++@++++We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?
We have three kids, Homer.++++@++++Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.
No, Maggie!++++@++++Oh yeah.
You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars.++++@++++One hundred and thirty million dollars!
Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again.++++@++++Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?
But we never ever...++++@++++I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money...
I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.++++@++++You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you.
Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away.++++@++++Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!
You can still win some money if you have five out of six.++++@++++Whoo-hoo!
Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one.++++@++++Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?
Give it to the poor.++++@++++What do kids know about spending money?
What are you gonna do, Homer?++++@++++Hmm...
Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something?++++@++++Look closer, Lenny!
Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold.++++@++++Fourteen carat gold!
And the second number is... three.++++@++++Receipts, ugh.
Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win.++++@++++Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be "10."
Grampa, he's not dead!++++@++++Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.
This is the part of the job I hate.++++@++++Hey, you did the best you could.
This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.++++@++++Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?++++@++++Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven.
Is there a Doggie Hell?++++@++++Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Who's in there?++++@++++Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Checkers.++++@++++Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...++++@++++But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Thanks, Mom.++++@++++All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
Please, do go on...++++@++++I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
Oh, please, continue...++++@++++I thought maybe you...
You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.++++@++++But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
I've found a way we can pay for the operation.++++@++++Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?
... will now be chub night.++++@++++Chub? I don't even know what that is!
We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...++++@++++Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...
You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.++++@++++Mmm... snouts.
Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist.++++@++++Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.
What's that?++++@++++A dinosaur.
C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'!++++@++++BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
Before his dog got sick, that "old rummy" used to be my best customer.++++@++++AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
Go get it, pal.++++@++++My quarter!!!
Homie, did you close the gate?++++@++++Yes.
The dog will get out!++++@++++Bart! Close the gate.
It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.++++@++++Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.++++@++++Uh...the last one.
Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.++++@++++That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.
Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven.++++@++++Oh, Marge! There is no such place!
I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.++++@++++And I'll be right here watching TV.
Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog.++++@++++Two tickets for...
You already petted him for ten minutes.++++@++++I know. I want to pet him again!
You can pet the cat.++++@++++The cat? What's the point?
Oh, there's a spot, dear.++++@++++Oooh, there's a good one.
That spot says "compact only".++++@++++Marge, that's just a suggested car size.
Uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad.++++@++++Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window.
"Honey, I Hit A School Bus"!++++@++++Look Who's Oinking! "Look Who's Oinking"!
Well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm?++++@++++That's right.
Maybe we could see something a little more adult.++++@++++Why Marge, you frisky little devil.
Ooh! The paper called it a "taut political thriller".++++@++++Political!
Get me Jed Kolick!++++@++++Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky...
Well of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school!++++@++++Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter.
Homie, aren't you coming inside?++++@++++Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again.
Them's fightin' words!++++@++++Duff please.
We don't sell Duff. We sell Fudd.++++@++++Okay, Fudd me.
They're all yours.++++@++++Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
YOU WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ SWEAT AND BREAK YOUR BACK/++++@++++Yeah...
THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR CASTLE/ BUT YOUR QUEEN WON'T CUT YOU SLACK/++++@++++... that's true.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LOSIN' ALL YOUR HAIR/... THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT/...++++@++++Uh-huh.
THAT'S WHY YOU FLIPPED YOUR PICK-UP TRUCK RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE/...++++@++++That's right, except for the pick-up truck.
THERE'S A LOT OF BULL THEY HAND YOU/ THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO/ YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ NO, YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU/ BUT I DO/++++@++++Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya.
I'm listenin'.++++@++++Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
So what's your name, stranger?++++@++++Homer J. Simpson.
My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.++++@++++That's a pretty name.
Oh, you think so?++++@++++Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
Where were you all night?++++@++++I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.
You should have called. I was very worried.++++@++++Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'.
Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.++++@++++Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town.
Well, if it isn't Homer J. Simpson.++++@++++Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since "Funky Town."
Oh, aren't you sweet.++++@++++Do you think I could get a copy of it?
Sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. "I'm Bastin' a Turkey With My Tears", "Don't Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It", "I'm Sick of Your Lyin' Lips and False Teeth"...++++@++++Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!
Well, I don't know.++++@++++Come with me!
Homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?++++@++++I guess so.
Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.++++@++++Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?
Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?++++@++++Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.
I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!++++@++++Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits.
Oh Homer, everybody's been callin'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you.++++@++++Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain.
Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return.++++@++++Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it.
Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.++++@++++Thanks. You did say sugar, right?
Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager.++++@++++Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures...
That's okay.++++@++++I make a lot of stupid decisions...
Nobody's perfect.++++@++++I did bad in school.
I didn't even go.++++@++++My personal hygiene has been described as...
I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing.++++@++++Uh, then maybe you better not look at me.
Homer! Where did you get that suit?++++@++++A friend bought it for me.
Was it Lurleen?++++@++++No... I think it was Lenny.
Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?++++@++++No!
Have you kissed her?++++@++++No!
Has she kissed you?++++@++++A coupla times.
I want you to stop seeing her.++++@++++I can't. I'm her manager.
Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.++++@++++Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.
Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?++++@++++Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there.
This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, "There is no way in hell that I'm gonna record in this dump".++++@++++I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
Homer, how much did you just give that man?++++@++++Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this.
Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!++++@++++Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?++++@++++I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!
Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?++++@++++Stop it.
Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track.++++@++++You, off the bench.
Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.++++@++++Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new.
Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up.++++@++++Let's hear it.
IN THIS TRAILER, I GET SO COLD AND LONELY/ LYIN' THERE AWAKE AT NIGHT/ MUTTERING IF ONLY YOU WEREN'T MARRIED/ SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ OH BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?++++@++++Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye.
Uh, Homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. Really listen. BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...++++@++++Uh-huh...
BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...++++@++++Right...
That's right Homer J.++++@++++Uh... I gotta think about this.
I gotta go. Homer...++++@++++Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready.
Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth.++++@++++That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?
You're not even listening to me!++++@++++Sure they will.
You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.++++@++++Uh... I gotta go.
Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?++++@++++Yes I am.
I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract.++++@++++Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.++++@++++Is there anything you need?
What's wrong?++++@++++My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
I'll love you for the rest of my life.++++@++++I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
I'll give you fifty bucks.++++@++++You son of a... Sold!
These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.++++@++++Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.
Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight.++++@++++Pfft.
Ewww.++++@++++Ooooh.
That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.++++@++++Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton.
Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha.++++@++++I am not.
Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma.++++@++++Hear hear!.
White. And what would you like for appetizers?++++@++++Oooh, appetizers.
Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?++++@++++Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!
Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.++++@++++Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?
Aunt Selma has one hour to live!++++@++++Hey, down in front.
Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!++++@++++Come again?
After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way.++++@++++To the Simpson mobile!
Hey Homer, let's book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act.++++@++++Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer.
My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.++++@++++Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.
Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.++++@++++I hear ya. Come on boy.
Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?++++@++++Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car.
Knock it off.++++@++++THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?++++@++++I'll be right back.
Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR.++++@++++Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar.
I meant a real guitar.++++@++++This is real.
And it came with a free instruction book.++++@++++Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!
Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!++++@++++Marge, what were you thinking?
That's not my voice!++++@++++Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
The admiral and I don't get along. Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.++++@++++Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"++++@++++Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, "Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut"?
Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.++++@++++All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
What's on?++++@++++It doesn't matter.
Hey, hey, I was just kidding.++++@++++That's it. He's outta here.
But Homer, we're the only family he's got...++++@++++I don't care. This is not "Happy Days" and he is not the Fonz.
Heyyy, Mr. S...++++@++++Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!
Maybe I should go.++++@++++So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
We start with pure milk chocolate...++++@++++Chocolate...
Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...++++@++++Ooh, sweet.
Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?++++@++++I'd say "You're a lying scumbag." Why sweetie?
According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.++++@++++Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.
They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.++++@++++Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?
Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.++++@++++Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?
Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?++++@++++Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety.
I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.++++@++++Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...++++@++++Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!
Well Milhouse, "'Tis better to have loved and lost"... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade.++++@++++Nah.
Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is?++++@++++The vernal equinox?
You've gained thirteen pounds.++++@++++Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!
You mean a spoon?++++@++++Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
Hey, no eating in the tank!++++@++++Go to hell.
How was your day at work, dear?++++@++++Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough...
And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics.++++@++++What the hell are you two...
There, there. You're safe now, little sister.++++@++++Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?
"Well, I never thought I'd see it. They're dancing on the Berlin Wall. These lithe and lively lovers of liberation..."++++@++++Boring.
Pyle!++++@++++Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house.
Yeah, you gonna to be okay?++++@++++Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse.
Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?++++@++++Would I!
All you have to do is sign this form.++++@++++Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.
All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!++++@++++Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?
EXCELLENCE!"++++@++++Herb!
Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as "the quality or condition of being excellent". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence.++++@++++Please please please please please...
Dad, you know you won.++++@++++Don't jinx it!
The winner... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!
You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight?++++@++++I miss my couch.
I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.++++@++++Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Let's do it.++++@++++I think I'm gonna take a walk.
But sir...++++@++++Dammit, I said full power!
Dad? Dad?++++@++++I'll take it.
This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that.++++@++++Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer.
This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.++++@++++All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.++++@++++You weren't so glad to see me.
I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.++++@++++Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?
Can't complain.++++@++++Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode.
Homer, he knows how to work a light switch.++++@++++Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does.
I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.++++@++++They do good work.
That's all I got.++++@++++Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman.
Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from "New Republic for Kids." Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: "Paradise Regained," "Martin Chuzzlewit," or Herman Melville's twin classics "Omoo" and "Typee".++++@++++Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?
How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?++++@++++Nah.
Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.++++@++++Twenty minutes?!
Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this.++++@++++It's drinking the water!
Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...++++@++++This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example.++++@++++It's going back for more!
Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother.++++@++++All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
Nope.++++@++++Okay, then just give me the drinking bird.
What do you think, Homer?++++@++++Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.
Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!++++@++++I try, but I can't.
You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.++++@++++Never mind.
Well, Homer, now what do you think?++++@++++I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.
I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.++++@++++I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother.++++@++++Well, when is he gonna act like it?
Homer, walk me to my car.++++@++++What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it.
This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same.++++@++++That's it?
That's it.++++@++++I see your point, brother.
Gimme a hug, brother.++++@++++All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school.++++@++++Well it is.
Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?++++@++++Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door.
Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C.++++@++++Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.
But Dad...++++@++++Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers.
8...++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Well, here goes nothin'.++++@++++Stupid roller-skate.
Well, dad, here's my report card. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.++++@++++A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?
No, sir.++++@++++You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
So I won't get to go to camp?++++@++++Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?
You mean I can go?++++@++++Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!++++@++++Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?
Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty.++++@++++Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?
Hey, hands off my pickle.++++@++++I don't see your name on it, boy.
No, but...++++@++++Oh yeah?
Good-bye my special little guy. Lisa, watch out for poison ivy. Remember, "Leaves of 3, let it be.++++@++++"Leaves of 4, eat some more."
You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished.++++@++++Oh no you're not.
Ohhh...++++@++++He-he-he.
Oh, that's wonderful.++++@++++And look. New hair!
Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever.++++@++++Size... right... agility!
Oh... Homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks.++++@++++Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.
I haven't been in a play since high school, and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.++++@++++Sounds interesting.
You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie... and sometimes it's like I don't even exist.++++@++++Sounds interesting.
It's time to name our five finalists, starting with... Miss Montana!++++@++++A beaut from Butte.
Miss South Carolina!++++@++++Nothin' could be finah.
Miss Delaware!++++@++++She, uh... Good for her.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.++++@++++Marge keep it down in there.
Tonight, my reign as Miss American Girl comes to an end. And I'd like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the United Nations.++++@++++Maggie! Cut that racket!
I'm auditioning for a play.++++@++++Well, this is the first I've heard about it.
I told you several times. It's a musical version of "A Streetcar Named..."++++@++++Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!
Well... I thought I told you..++++@++++Kids, back me up.
Sorry.++++@++++Match point, Homer.
I'm sorry, Honey.++++@++++That's okay. We're none of us perfect.
I don't think so.++++@++++Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?
Homer, can you run some lines with me?++++@++++Make Bart do it.
Gutterball.++++@++++You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too.
I'm sorry, Llewellyn. I just... I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face. Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?++++@++++Marge, your ride's here.
Marge! Marge! I'm asking for white hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit!++++@++++Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?
Oh here!++++@++++Hey, there's quarters in here!
Marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. You can't let that happen.++++@++++Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car.
All I want is one embrace.++++@++++Marge, move it or lose it!
Heah you ah, Homah.++++@++++Wha th... Why are you talking like that?
Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.++++@++++I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
See you later, kids. Ah've got to go rehearse with Ned.++++@++++But Marge, what about dessert?
For God's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!++++@++++Fine. I will!
Why? Are you going?++++@++++Well I gotta, don't I?
I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is.++++@++++Probably not much of it.
Why can't you be a little more supportive?++++@++++Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.
What kooky projects?++++@++++You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing.
Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?++++@++++You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.
If I break, buy a new one++++@++++Maggie, time to go to the...
It's mom!++++@++++Huh?
Almost everybody.++++@++++Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing.
Lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?++++@++++Shut up boy.
Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up.++++@++++I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her.
Blanche.++++@++++Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her.
Let's get 'em!++++@++++I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
Get up, Homer. It's time for church.++++@++++Don' wanna go.
It's church. You have to go.++++@++++Too cold out!
I'm tired of having this argument every Sunday. Get dressed.++++@++++Oh, stupid itchy church pants...
Come on. We're going to be late.++++@++++Forget it. I'm not going.
It's eleven KBBL degrees below zero. I hope you're someplace warm.++++@++++You bet your sweet... ass!
Who wears short shorts?++++@++++I wear short shorts!
Of course, Johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. If you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!++++@++++I know that!
Homer, can you name that title?++++@++++This Things I Believe.
Uh... can we accept that?++++@++++Woo-hoo!
You heard the lady - grab her spine and get cracking.++++@++++Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader.
Let's define our terms, gentleman. Are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? Because the two are by no means the same.++++@++++Oh, well... can't win 'em all.
We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.++++@++++Yesss!
Oh, doctor. A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. Three visits from Morganna The Kissing Bandit... and the astonishing return of Jim Brown...++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Mmm, hmm.++++@++++I... found... a penny!
That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.++++@++++Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again.
Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?++++@++++No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes.
I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer.++++@++++Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?
Amen, brother.++++@++++And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
Tell it, daddy!++++@++++And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways.++++@++++Marge, come to bed.
No, Homer. He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord. He just likes to sleep in on Sundays...++++@++++Maarge... come to bed Marge...
THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!++++@++++Well... kind of... but...
BUT WHAT?++++@++++And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team?++++@++++No. They moved to Phoenix.
Oh yeah.++++@++++You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.++++@++++Give him one for me.
I will.++++@++++So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way.
Dad, can I ask you a question?++++@++++Sure, honey.
Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?++++@++++Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.
No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.++++@++++Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path.
Oh, really?++++@++++Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge.
So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?++++@++++Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there"?++++@++++Yeah... think about it.
Pretty slick.++++@++++Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling....
Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.++++@++++No sale.
GET THOSE ANIMALS OUT ON THE ARKY, ARKY -++++@++++Leave me alone!
I see him, son.++++@++++Where are we going?
I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked.++++@++++Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some "wild" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --
Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.++++@++++There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
Coming up next, "Make Your Own Ladder."++++@++++Very sure.
Hello. I'm collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns. Last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of seventy-five Jewish clowns. The worst incident was during our convention in Lubbock, Texas. There were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere... it was terrible...++++@++++Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?
A religious clown thing, yes.++++@++++Sorry.
Oh, but I am. I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.++++@++++Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?
Please do not offer my god a peanut.++++@++++No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz.
O-kay.++++@++++Flanders, you saved me. Why?
Help! Help!++++@++++That's right, old friend.
Oh, Homey! Are you all right?++++@++++My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone.
Truly this was an act of God.++++@++++Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!
Any valuables in the house?++++@++++Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars...
Sorry, this policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.++++@++++Well, that's just great.
Coming up next... Which works better - springy clothes pins, or the other kind?++++@++++You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.
Yes, the lesson is...++++@++++No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!
Ah, that's super.++++@++++I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am.
Now, would you give church another try?++++@++++I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!
That's game, Hendrix!++++@++++God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?
Homer, I can't tell you that.++++@++++C'mon.
You'll find out when you die.++++@++++I can't wait that long.
You can't wait six months?++++@++++No, tell me now!
I'd say... 53 years old and 420 pounds.++++@++++Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!
A ride on the famous Duff Beer Blimp!++++@++++A ride on the Duff Blimp...
You see the circular pattern on those fields? That's from central-pivot irrigation.++++@++++Wow.
Oops! Sorry.++++@++++Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer..
We have one at home. You never use it.++++@++++Well, I want that one.
And the winner of the blimp ride is... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Oh my God!
Dad, do you think I'm ugly?++++@++++What are you talking about?
I'm an ugmo.++++@++++Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.
Fathers have to say that stuff.++++@++++Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?
No! You're homely as a mule's butt!++++@++++There, see?
Mmmm... no.++++@++++How about you, Barney?
Not for a second .++++@++++I need help.
That is so sweet.++++@++++Lisa's age seven to nine!
What a feeling! I'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning.++++@++++That could be Lisa!
Sure!++++@++++Where'd you get all the money?
No! No! I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.++++@++++Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?
To shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.++++@++++Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?
What are you talking about?++++@++++I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates.
Homer, Lisa's already sensitive about her looks. This is the last thing she needs.++++@++++But I think she'll win.
Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba.++++@++++Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.
You're looking at her through a father's eyes.++++@++++Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she's beautiful.
But that ride meant everything to him!++++@++++Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --
My name is Amber Dempsey, and when I grow up, I want to be a sweetie pie!++++@++++No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return.
Like what?++++@++++I'll tell you when you're older.
I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.++++@++++Hey... hey!
Whooo! Whooo! Dad, do you know anything else about women?++++@++++Nope, that's it.
My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Little Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place!++++@++++Yeah! Clean up this stink hole!
Ooh, that just kept goin' huh? And now here's... ... Lisa Simpson!++++@++++They'll love you just as much as I do.
But you're a role model to young people. And we're thinking of retiring "Menthol Moose".++++@++++Bless you boys.
Homer, those are ice cream men.++++@++++I know.
Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?++++@++++I don't know. Was I drunk?
Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do.++++@++++Really?
Hey Homer - where's your present?++++@++++Oh yeah? With what?
Hey!++++@++++I will get you one now!
We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt!++++@++++Well, I need something for my son's birthday.
Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse.++++@++++Ooh, that's bad.
But it comes with a free frogurt.++++@++++That's good.
The frogurt is also cursed.++++@++++That's bad.
But you get your choice of topping.++++@++++That's good.
That's bad.++++@++++Can I go now?
...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.++++@++++Woo hoo!
I'm Krusty the Clown and I'm going to kill you!++++@++++Didn't even pull the string that time.
Homer, what's wrong?++++@++++That doll tried to kill me!
I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?++++@++++Don't leave me alone with him.
Guess who, Fat Boy?++++@++++Marge, Marge, look!
Oh my God.++++@++++The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
I love you, Homer.++++@++++Come here you.
Here ya' go buddy.++++@++++Did you walk the dog?
Yeah, he buried me a couple a times.++++@++++Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.
And?++++@++++Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
Smithers, this is a golden opportunity. If we get him alive we can put him on Broadway. Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the Army!++++@++++Ooo.
Dad, we did something very bad.++++@++++Did you wreck the car?
Uh huh.++++@++++All right then.
Homer, did you barricade the door?++++@++++Why? Oh, the zombies. No.
It's our only hope.++++@++++To the book depository!
Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders!++++@++++He was a zombie?
The zombies have the earthlings on the run.++++@++++I'm a-comin' boy!
Ow... careful... not the face.++++@++++Barney! Not you, too!
I'm not a zombie. But hey, when in Rome... Wow, George Washington.++++@++++Take that Washington!
Shh! TV!++++@++++Man... fall down. Funny.
What are we going to have?++++@++++Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
Poison pizza.++++@++++Oh no. I'm not making two stops.
That's the way we do it every year.++++@++++All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
Is it 37?++++@++++I mean, no.
Oh, all right.++++@++++Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!
Ach.++++@++++Hee hee!
Mr. Simpson... I just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with Lisa. You must have read to her at a young age.++++@++++I did. I did read to her!
I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!++++@++++Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool.
Uh... we'd like the desk back Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Huh? Oh.
Just do it.++++@++++Bus-ted!
Homer, we have a problem here.++++@++++Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
We're talking about Bart.++++@++++Oh. That guy.
Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.++++@++++He's the boy you love to hate.
Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes.++++@++++Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.
You already put me in a home.++++@++++Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on "60 Minutes."
Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!++++@++++Dad, you and your stories... "Bart broke my teeth"... "the nurses are stealing my money"... "this thing on my neck is getting bigger"...
Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.++++@++++But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present.
Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?++++@++++All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours.
Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly...++++@++++Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.
I promise.++++@++++Thataboy.
Wow.++++@++++Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?
Indeed I did.++++@++++Hey you goats, get outta here!
Ayy, el estomago!++++@++++Run along, ya little scamp.
Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells...++++@++++Bart! Why are you doing that?
I'unno.++++@++++Well, this time you must be punished.
Well, you could punish me, but...++++@++++No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute...
Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.++++@++++Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
Why are you letting him do this?++++@++++I'unno.
Well punish him!++++@++++All right. All right. Bart, go to your room.
How could you let this happen?++++@++++How could you let this happen?
I wasn't here!++++@++++Oh. How convenient.
Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?++++@++++Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.++++@++++Now who's being naive.
Look, you have to help discipline your son.++++@++++All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick.
It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled "That Happy Cat".++++@++++Sorry, but the punishment stands.
We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.++++@++++Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?
Come on, Homer. This isn't funny.++++@++++Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!
Come on, go nuts.++++@++++Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?++++@++++Hmm...
I regret nothing!++++@++++Someday you'll thank me for this, son.
Not bloody likely.++++@++++No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage.
Dad, what's the point of this story?++++@++++I like stories.
Look, can I please go to the movie?++++@++++I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV.
TV sucks.++++@++++I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that.
Homer, we'd like to talk to you.++++@++++But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine.++++@++++Don't you think I know that?
Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him.++++@++++Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a "Mister Tight Buns" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen.
Well, Dad, I guess you won.++++@++++No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special.
Come on. What d'ya say?++++@++++All right. I think you've learned your lesson.
One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.++++@++++I'll get it son.
One Soylent Green. Hold the butter.++++@++++Mmm... Soylent Green.
Itchy.++++@++++Itchy's a jerk.
Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of "Lemon Time"...++++@++++Oooh, give it here.
Homer, that's dish washing liquid!++++@++++Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?
Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.++++@++++I wish I could retire.
Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar.++++@++++Can't talk -- busy.
Did you notice how slanted he looked?++++@++++All part of God's great plan.
Haw haw!++++@++++The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such instructional videos as "Mothballing Your Battleship" and "Dig Your Own Grave - and Save!" Now over the next six hours I'll be taking you through the do's and do not do's of foundation repair. Ready?++++@++++Ready!
First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel...++++@++++Hand me my patching trowel, boy.
Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?++++@++++No.
Good. Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws. Install.++++@++++Wha-do I do...
After applying brushable coating to the panels...++++@++++Wait a minute...
....you'll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.++++@++++Wait a minute...
If you can't find metal stucco lath....++++@++++Uh huh?
Now, parge the lath...++++@++++Did you see the bubble?
I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. I figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred.++++@++++Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet "Cue Ball," the man with no hair!++++@++++Huh?
We have to do something...++++@++++Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need.
I could get a job.++++@++++Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
Tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours...++++@++++Bo-ring!
A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley.++++@++++Bo-ring.
Where does the Bible say "racket?"....++++@++++It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad.
curator of large mammals?++++@++++Marge have you seen my lunch box?
We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.++++@++++Yeah, lemonade is good.
I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.++++@++++Wha dey do?
I'll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork.++++@++++Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under "R" for arrivederci.
But, where does it go?++++@++++Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do.
That woman -- she's so captivating. Smithers, my heart's pounding like a jackhammer.++++@++++Marge, get my gun.
It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.++++@++++You can't take our donuts!
Springtime fresh, winter white... what could be better?++++@++++Oh, man, I really gotta...
Homie, what's wrong?++++@++++I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder.++++@++++Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.++++@++++Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight.
You know the problem here was water leakage. If you just buy a fifty cent washer --++++@++++I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too.++++@++++No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.
You love her, too.++++@++++Damn right!
Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life.++++@++++Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice.
Huh, huh, but, I'm going to have to go with Shasta 'cause she liked makin' bacon on the beach.++++@++++Ooh, me too.
Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move...++++@++++Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?
Yes, well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home. First, whenever you walk in front of your window could you please wear pants?++++@++++Mmm... no.
Second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens.++++@++++Mmm... no.
And please cover your garbage. It's attracting wildlife.++++@++++Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!
That medicine's not for you.++++@++++Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen.
Set sail for "The Fryin' Dutchman."++++@++++Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant.
But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions.++++@++++Mmmm, shrimp.
I guess I should explain. Laura's father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career.++++@++++My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
Hurts, don't it?++++@++++...All you can eat, ha!
Daad!++++@++++Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels.
I'll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.++++@++++Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around...
My divorce.++++@++++That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing.
Well I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites.++++@++++Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food.
I'm not.++++@++++Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?
Right.++++@++++I hear you loud and clear.
Excellent choice... and for the gentleman?++++@++++All you can eat. All you can eat.
Six bells, time for closin'.++++@++++Can't talk... eating.
Fairly warned be thee, says I.++++@++++Hey, hey, hey!
Oh, please don't. For me?++++@++++Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills...
Don Quixote?++++@++++No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha.
Don Quixote.++++@++++No!
I really think that was the character's name... Don Quixote!++++@++++Fine. I'll look it up.
Well, who was it?++++@++++Never mind.
It's not working!++++@++++All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!
Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film "The Neverending Story."++++@++++So you think I have a case?
Homer, I don't use the word "hero" very often. But you are the greatest hero in American history.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Dad, I have some questions about women.++++@++++Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know.++++@++++But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did.
Are you sure...?++++@++++Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.
Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?++++@++++Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!
Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad.++++@++++Thanks, that means a lot to me.
It was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.++++@++++Hey!
Uh, there's a pizza here for...++++@++++Right here.
Hi, Homie. It's really starting to snow. I think you should come home.++++@++++But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban.
You're dead weight, Marty.++++@++++Ohh.
Now, before I give you the check, one more question: Uh, this place "Moe's" you left just before the accident: this is a business of some kind?++++@++++It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography.
She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.++++@++++What country is this car from?
This exhibit is closed.++++@++++The Batmobile!
Michelle Pfeiffer... ha! The only true "Catwoman" is Julie Newmar, Lee Merriwether or Eartha Kitt. And I didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure West. And how come Batman doesn't dance anymore? Remember the Batusi?++++@++++Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.
Homer, I've got to sneak these viable artworks out of the White House. But I can't get out of my driveway because of those protesters.++++@++++Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality.
Pally, this doesn't cost money, it makes money! You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.++++@++++Well... I really should discuss this with my wife.
Your wife?++++@++++What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?
I can't believe you bought that plow. We can't afford it.++++@++++If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things.
Good.++++@++++Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!
Oh, Homie, didn't that hurt?++++@++++No.
And now, to read from the Epistles of St. Paul, Homer Simpson.++++@++++Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226.
Homer, this is really low.++++@++++Not as low as my low, low prices.
Act now and get a bonus CD: "Hornpipe Fever." Arrgh.++++@++++Hmmm.
Dad, who's watching TV at 3:17 a.m.?++++@++++Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners...
Look! There we are!++++@++++It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!
That's right! I fill your driveways with ice and snow! What are you gonna do about it? Nuthin', that's what.++++@++++Stop!
Mr. Plow!++++@++++Get out of here, you lousy... season!
All right... I'm goin'... My head hurts. I have to lie down for a while.++++@++++Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?
But I'm a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system?++++@++++Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage.
You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you Mr. Plow?++++@++++Shut up, boy.
I wish I was a hero.++++@++++Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be.
Here I come world!++++@++++How do you think he'll do, Moe?
This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind...++++@++++Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?
No. No. Could you wear the Mr. Plow jacket. Just uh... for fun.++++@++++Oooh. Heh heh heh.
Hi ya, Homer! Say hello to the Plow King!++++@++++Barney, you stole my idea!
Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding.++++@++++Flanders, I thought I was your plow man.
Ah, Homer, why don't you plow it again?++++@++++Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
Hello, I'm calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors --++++@++++Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from "Leave It To Beaver"? Yeah, they were gay.
I think you should do a new ad. One that's fresh and original.++++@++++I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE.
Promise you'll never do that again.++++@++++All right.
Dad, was that your commercial?++++@++++I don't know.
These look like teeth marks.++++@++++I thought there was chocolate inside.
That's great Arnie.++++@++++Hmm...
I don't know. I'd be up there all day... I wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways...++++@++++There's a $10,000 bill in it for you.
Oh yeah? Which president's on it?++++@++++Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
Well, I guess you can plow my driveway. But I wonder what happened to the Plow King.++++@++++Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers.
Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?++++@++++Kiss my asphalt.
Homie, please don't go.++++@++++Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.
Ah, dying's not so bad. I'll be reunited with my loved ones. My dad... and that plant I never watered.++++@++++Barney!
Homer, you saved my life and I'm not gonna forget it. From now on, we'll be partners.++++@++++Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them.
Hello, this is the Repo Depot. I'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.++++@++++Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --
Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something.++++@++++You mean...
He does not.++++@++++Maggie, can you say "daddy"? Dad-dy?
Well, don't push her. Remember, "Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."++++@++++Takes one to know one!
Tell it, Mom. Tell, it Mom.++++@++++Yeah, tell it, Mom.
I miss-a da Klinger already.++++@++++WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT...
Homer.++++@++++Daddy.
Da... da... da...++++@++++Ye-esss...
Domer.++++@++++Why you little...
Hi yo!++++@++++Heh, heh. Got your nose.
Got your wallet.++++@++++Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?
Guess what, Homie... There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.++++@++++We're gonna start doin' it in the morning?
We're going to have another baby.++++@++++Marge that's...
I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.++++@++++No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21!
Won't that warp him?++++@++++My cousin Frank did it.
You don't have a cousin Frank.++++@++++He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now.
Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat, you'll wonder how you ever did without it.++++@++++Mmmm. Hog fat.
Just imagine what we can do with this place.++++@++++Wow. How much? How much?
Well, here's what they're asking.++++@++++I can't afford that!
Why'd you come to me. I don't know nothing. I used to get by on my looks. Now they're gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit.++++@++++Are you done?
No, not yet. I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York.++++@++++Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home.
Oh! Well, all I own is this house, that I built with my own two hands.++++@++++You didn't build this house. You won
All right, son. I'll sell this dump and write you a check.++++@++++Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us.
So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home?++++@++++About three weeks.
Mommy.++++@++++Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
When are we going to get to my first word?++++@++++Your what-what?
My first word.++++@++++Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes.
Daaad!++++@++++Wait a minute. That was a "Lucy" show... Okay, where were we?
Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole.++++@++++Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...
Hey, Homer. This house sucks.++++@++++Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me "Daddy."
Buenos dias, neighboritos. The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned.++++@++++Hi, Flanders.
If you need anything, just give a whistle.++++@++++I could use a TV tray.
Well, gee, I...++++@++++Whaat?
I just this minute bought it at the hardware st...++++@++++You said, anything.
Sure, you can borrow it for a little while.++++@++++And that "little while" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh.
Bart, get out!++++@++++Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day.
Krusty funny.++++@++++Duh.
Crib! Crib! I'm a baby!++++@++++All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib.
... The Americans are heavy favorites.++++@++++Patience, my pet.
Homie... I think the baby's coming.++++@++++Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?
Coming up next, an hour-long episode of Mama's Family.++++@++++Yes!
We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson. Enjoy the miracle of creation.++++@++++Shut up, Flanders.
Can you say "David Hasselhoff"?++++@++++Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.
According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her.++++@++++Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
Where's the beef? What the hell's that supposed to mean?++++@++++Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
You people are pigs! I personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger.++++@++++I like those odds.
Ouch! But first, let's go to the boxing venue.++++@++++Please, please, please, please, please...
Davah Hassahoff.++++@++++Can you say "Daddy"?
I'm sorry, Bart, you're too little.++++@++++Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr...++++@++++Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.
Wow! Lisa, can you say "Mommy"?++++@++++No, sweetie. "Daddy."
Did too.++++@++++Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.
It's not good for your heart.++++@++++My heart is just fine...
Homie, what is it?++++@++++Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!
Homer, I prepared a special surprise just for you.++++@++++It could only be one thing.
Nice healthy oatmeal.++++@++++Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat. Ugh, there's a bug in it.
No there isn't.++++@++++Trust me.
Dad, there's a bug on that.++++@++++Eh.
It's your heart. And I think it's on its last thump.++++@++++Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
Now don't worry, Homer. You're the kind of guy I could really dig. A grave for. Your indolence is inefficacious!++++@++++Huh?
Clear!++++@++++More.
Oh, Homie, I was so frightened.++++@++++Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes.
What a voice. Young Homer is going to make me a millionaire.++++@++++OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed.
Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you've just had a mild heart attack.++++@++++But I'm out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
Oh no, quite the opposite. It's made you weak as a kitten. Look!++++@++++Hey, c'mon, quit it.
Coochy coochy coo!++++@++++Stop. Please stop.
Oh, you swing like a girl. Come on, now.++++@++++Please, have mercy.
Got your nose.++++@++++Not funny.
How 'bout this little bee?++++@++++No! Remember your hippopotamus oath.
Well, we can't fix his heart, but we can tell you exactly how damaged it is.++++@++++What an age we live in!
Good lord.++++@++++Hi.
Now Homer, this is a new body fat analysis test. I start you jiggling, and measure how long it takes to stop.++++@++++Woo hoo, look at that blubber fly.
Homer, I'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary by-pass operation.++++@++++Say it in English, doc.
You're going to need open heart surgery!++++@++++Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
We're going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker.++++@++++Could you dumb it down a shade?
Seventy dollars.++++@++++Hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?
No. Don't you have health insurance at work?++++@++++Well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge.
Now before we give you health insurance, I have to ask you a few questions.++++@++++Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away.
Oh good. Now, under "Heart Attacks" you crossed out "3" and wrote "0".++++@++++Oh, I thought that said, "Brain Hemorrhages."
Uh huh. And uh, do you drink?++++@++++I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas.
All right. Here's your policy.++++@++++Now let me tell you something, Mr. Sucker... I just...
Oh, hold on there, you still have to sign it.++++@++++Oh. I...
Sir, I'm sorry, we can't insure you.++++@++++I made an "H".
No, that doesn't count.++++@++++Looks like an "X."
We'd better get you to a hospital.++++@++++Can I have a free calendar?
Mr. Simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.++++@++++I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
Honey, did you have any luck?++++@++++No, but the rabbi gave me this.
What is it, Dad?++++@++++Son, they call it a "droodle". Whoo hoo! Look at him go!
Hi Everybody. Are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses?++++@++++Bo-ring.
Okay, friend. You tried the best, now try the rest. Call 1-600-DOCTORB. The "B" is for bargain!++++@++++Well, Marge, we could do worse.
How?++++@++++Uh... some dog could do the operation.
Operation? What are you talking about?++++@++++Kids, I have something to tell you.
We feel neither highs nor lows.++++@++++Really? What's it like?
Eh.++++@++++Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
Dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?++++@++++Uh, yeah.
Oh, no. What if they botch it? I won't have a dad... for a while.++++@++++Kids. Kids... I'm not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.
What about Abraham Lincoln?++++@++++Uh... he sold poison milk to school children.
Homer Simpson! Well, if that don't put the "dink" in co-inky-dink.++++@++++Flanders? What are you doin' here?
I'm having a kidney and a lung removed.++++@++++Who are you donating them to?
First come, first served! What are you in for?++++@++++I got a bad heart.
If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would.++++@++++Shut up, Flanders.
Ah, you know, Homer, that beer ain't free.++++@++++Dear Lord, I'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. If something happens, please look after Marge, and make sure my kids grow up right.
Shhh.++++@++++Sorry.
In heaven, you get to do whatever you like best, all the time.++++@++++Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...
Hey, what's the matter? Oh, that's right. My grotesque appearance.++++@++++Krusty, why are you here?
Oh, it's part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump.++++@++++Oh well, I could use a good laugh.
Well, there's nothing funny about what you're about to go through. I know, I'm in the Zipper Club myself.++++@++++You seem okay.
We passed this card around at work.++++@++++Gee, thanks, guys.
When I first heard about the operation, I was against it. But then I thought, if Homer wants to be a woman, so be it.++++@++++Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!
Uh, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old time's sake.++++@++++Thanks, Moe.
Oh Homie, I could never remarry...++++@++++Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows.
Ohhh... kids, you can come in now.++++@++++Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let's see... uh... Oh, I'm no good at this.
Thanks dad.++++@++++And Lisa...
Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of.++++@++++Like a giant billboard that says, "No fat chicks"?
Ordah! Please rise for the a Pledge of Allegiance.++++@++++Get to the money!
Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town.++++@++++Bo-ring!
Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.++++@++++Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!
You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!++++@++++Heh-heh... mule.
MONORAIL / MONORAIL / MONORAIL!++++@++++Mono...
I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.++++@++++Well, you should have written a song like that guy.
Are you stuck in a dead-end job?++++@++++Maybe.
Are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?++++@++++What's it to ya?
Are you on your third beer of the evening?++++@++++Does whiskey count as beer?
Actual institute may not match photo.++++@++++Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor.
Homer, no...++++@++++It's my life-long dream.
Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?++++@++++Oh, yeah.
True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?++++@++++Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true.
No, you were right, it's "false." Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!++++@++++That's right, boy.
You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job.++++@++++Heh-heh. Kids.
But now, I want to follow in your footsteps.++++@++++Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!
According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?++++@++++"What if?" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!
It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.++++@++++We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?
Goodnight, Homer.++++@++++What if I talk like this?
But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.++++@++++Who, me?
Yeah, sure.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!++++@++++I call the big one Bitey.
Is there a chance the track could bend?++++@++++I call the big one Bitey.
Is there a chance the track could bend.++++@++++I call the big one Bitey.
Can't you stop it, Dad?++++@++++I'm trying my best.
Does anyone wanna switch seats?++++@++++I did it!
Homer? Homer?++++@++++Y'ello.
Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you.++++@++++Batman?
No, he's a scientist.++++@++++Batman's a scientist.
Dad, you're a hero!++++@++++Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was.
And "The Washing Machine"!++++@++++Wowww.
See the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous Beerquarium!++++@++++Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens.
Yayyy!++++@++++Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?
We're under six!++++@++++And I'm a college student! Heh, heh.
No use complaining about something you can't change.++++@++++But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
Oh Homer, quit pouting.++++@++++I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead woman.
If you don't mind! We're on our way to a funeral.++++@++++Ding-dong, the witch is dead.
WHICH OLD WITCH?++++@++++Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me.++++@++++Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!++++@++++Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good.
Homer, that's very rude of you.++++@++++What?
Another placemat, sir?++++@++++Please.
Patty, I want a baby.++++@++++Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers.
These chips were my children, Marjorie. Take special care of them.++++@++++Uh, oh.
Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?++++@++++Sure... unless another aunt dies.
Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?++++@++++Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot.
Have you been eating that sandwich again?++++@++++Sand... wich...
Geez, we hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie.++++@++++I'll give it a good home.
You've been eating that thing for a week. I think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.++++@++++Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you should throw it away.++++@++++Suggestion noted.
Are you going to eat it?++++@++++Yes.
You look terrible.++++@++++I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
Your lips are turning blue. I think you'd better stay home.++++@++++No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!
Goodbye Dad! Don't eat any solids.++++@++++But I love solids.
Do you feel any better?++++@++++No. What are the odds of getting sick on a Saturday? A thousand to one.
Well, to cheer you up I rented a couple of videos. "Boxing's Greatest Weigh-Ins" and "Yentl".++++@++++Yentl? Whuzzat?
It deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter Rabbinical school.++++@++++Sounds great!
What's going on here? Oh, Yentl. I might have known.++++@++++That Yentl puts the "she" in Yeshiva.
Hmmm, well, you've cooled down.++++@++++That's what you think .
You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better.++++@++++The Erotic Adventures of Hercules.
With Norman Fell as Zeus!++++@++++Woo hoo!
I can't. The beans'll burn.++++@++++Homercles cares not for beans.
How do you do it, Homer?++++@++++You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this...
Homer, we're going to my sisters'! Remember, pick up Bart!++++@++++I'm on my way!
After sixteen glorious seasons, the Green Bay faithful bid farewell to Bryan Bartlett Starr.++++@++++Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something.
Hey Homie, I can see your doodle!++++@++++Shut up, Flanders.
He called you a bad father.++++@++++Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate.
Homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?++++@++++It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya.
No, no. Someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called "The Corey hotline."++++@++++Wasn't me.
Dad, can I...++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand.++++@++++Hit me.
Twenty.++++@++++Hit me.
Twenty-one.++++@++++Hit me.
Father-son picnic.++++@++++Have a good time! Wait a minute.
Bart, I could kiss you, if the Bigger Brothers hadn't made me sign a form promising I wouldn't. No one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. Now, let's set down at that Frogurt stand.++++@++++So that's it!
Playing with Milhouse.++++@++++No, you haven't! You've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven't you, haven't you. Look at me.
Dad, it just kinda happened. You're taking this too hard.++++@++++How would you like me to take it? "Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I'll be waiting for you?" I'm sorry, I can't do it.
And what are your reasons for wanting a little brother?++++@++++Uh... Revenge.
Any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you.++++@++++Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!...
Do you have a bigger brother for me yet? Okay. I'll be back in an hour.++++@++++I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde?
Just like Oscar the Grouch.++++@++++Pepi!
Poppa Homer!++++@++++Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now.
Your son Bart sounds very bad.++++@++++Oh, he is.
Shaddap!++++@++++Mmm... grapefruit.
Why does it stop there?++++@++++Because it's a stupid piece of junk!
Tell me more! I want to know all the constellations!++++@++++Well, there's... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy.
Oh, Poppa Homer, you are so learned.++++@++++"Learned," son, it's pronounced "learned."
I love you, Poppa Homer.++++@++++I love you too, Pepsi.
Pepi.++++@++++Pepi.
Hey, Homer, have you seen my skateboard?++++@++++I gave it to Pepi.
Who the hell is Pepi?++++@++++He's my little brother. That's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
Who needs you? Tom's a better father than you ever were.++++@++++Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing?
I was faking it.++++@++++Liar!
Oh yeah? Remember this? "Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!..."++++@++++Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
Is that true?++++@++++No.
Come on, Bart. You know better than to talk to strangers.++++@++++For your information, I'm his father!
His father? The drunk and gambler?++++@++++That's right. And who might you be?
Uh... Homer?++++@++++Oh. Right.
Another beer, Dad?++++@++++Thanks, son.
Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, "I'm a hemophiliac" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?++++@++++Yeah?
Will you teach me how to do that?++++@++++Sure, boy.
And this is for my Huggy Bug in honor of this special day.++++@++++Happy... Valentine's Day!
Ah, thank you, dear.++++@++++Woo hoo!
I'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad?++++@++++Uh, kind of. Nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day.
Hey, Dad. Why don't you give Mom her present?++++@++++What a nice idea, son. It's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I'll just go get it.
One hundred dollars.++++@++++What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!
Ohh, I think you will.++++@++++Forget it, pal!
La da de / La da da... La da dum da de da da dum da dum da de++++@++++All right. But I'll never shop here again.
Nickel off on expired baby food.++++@++++Sold!
Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show!++++@++++I'd sell my first-born son.
Ralph thinks I like him. But I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.++++@++++Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it?
Well, honey, I--++++@++++Let me handle this, Marge. I've heard 'em all. "I like you as a friend," "I think we should see other people," I no speak English"...
I get the idea.++++@++++"I'm married to the sea," "I don't want to kill you, but I will--
Forget it. To get those tickets our parents would have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite.++++@++++Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
Oh no, it's Ralph! Just make some excuse.++++@++++She's in the can. Go away.
Yes, sir. I'd do anything for Lisa.++++@++++Really?
Mr. Simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy.++++@++++Yeah, they'll do that.
Dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?++++@++++Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?
Well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me.++++@++++Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do.
Homer, that's a terrible thing to say.++++@++++Oh, shaddup.
Yeah. You got a tail-light out.++++@++++Where?
Right there.++++@++++You know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops.
Hasta la vista, Abie.++++@++++C'mon, boy! Finish him off!
And now, our evening comes to an end...++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, I want you to encourage Lisa with her science fair project.++++@++++Yeah, syrup is better than jelly.
Yes please!++++@++++Where's your Science Fair project, boy?
Bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!++++@++++Whelp, time to go to work.
I'd also like to express my fondness for that particular beer.++++@++++The man never drank a Duff in his life.
What does the future hold for Duff? Let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve.++++@++++Like what?
Um, I'd rather not get into it right now.++++@++++Why not?
All right, we don't have any ideas for the future. We got nothing. Happy?++++@++++No.
Hey, thanks a lot. That makes it all worthwhile.++++@++++Mmmm... Gummi Beer.
Are you crazy? We still haven't tried Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff, Tartar Control Duff...++++@++++Barney, give me your keys. You're too drunk to drive.
I'm fine.++++@++++Okay, you leave me no option.
Ow. What was that for?++++@++++I'm trying to knock you out.
Look alive, boys. Coupla stewed prunes headed your way.++++@++++Gulp.
Your license is hereby revoked and you are to attend traffic school and two months of Alch-anon meetings.++++@++++Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record.
What a terrible waste. Hi! I'm actor, Troy McClure. You might remember me from such Driver's Ed films as "Alice's Adventures through the Windshield Glass" and "The Decapitation of Larry Leadfoot." For the next 60 minutes we'll be seeing actual film of car crash victims.++++@++++It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh.
My name is Hans. Drinking has ruined my life. I'm thirty-one years old.++++@++++My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come.
Homie, do you ever drink alone?++++@++++Does the Lord count as a person?
Do you need a beer to fall asleep?++++@++++Thank you, that'd be nice.
Do you ever hide beer around the house?++++@++++Do I ever!
Homie, I'd like you to do something for me.++++@++++You name it.
I want you to give up beer for a month.++++@++++You got it. No deer for a month.
Did you say beer or deer?++++@++++Deer.
Please, Homie, I know you can do this.++++@++++All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month.
What was that noise?++++@++++I was saying "Pssst. I love you."
Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all.++++@++++Well, beer... we've had some great times.
Dang, I was aiming for his head.++++@++++Hm. Alcohol fueled car.
You thinking what I'm thinking?++++@++++T.V. have you turned on me, too?
The windup and the two two pitch... Oh no! The batter is calling for time... Looks like he's going and getting himself a new bat. And now there's a beachball on the field. And the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it.++++@++++I never realized how boring this game is.
Don't be scared Jubjub. It's mama.++++@++++I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
So Homer, please feel free to tell us anything. There's no judgment here.++++@++++The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.++++@++++Nooooo!
I'm proud of you, Homie.++++@++++Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded.
You don't have to start drinking right away. I was thinking we could go for a bike ride.++++@++++But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill...
You've saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants.++++@++++Yoink.
Ow.++++@++++Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife.
That is one evil dude.++++@++++It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life.
Now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the Springfield Grapplarium! Tonight, a Texas death match... Dr. Hillbilly vs. the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring!++++@++++I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.
Homer, Lisa needs Braces.++++@++++Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar.
Soon!++++@++++Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?
Bullseye!++++@++++Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.
Lisa needs braces.++++@++++If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces.
I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure.++++@++++You know what I think of this contract?
Congratulations, Homer!++++@++++Hey, what does this job pay?
... Unless you're crooked.++++@++++Woo hoo!
This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.++++@++++And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you.++++@++++Mmm. Gratzi.
Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the...++++@++++Eh-Eh-Eh.
Do you think you can get the dental plan back?++++@++++Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me.
Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish.++++@++++Done and done! Heh, heh, heh.
Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.++++@++++Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?
After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows.++++@++++Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no.
Honey, you look fine.++++@++++Who is it?
Goons.++++@++++Who?
Hired goons.++++@++++Hired goons?
Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you.++++@++++You know, you could have just called me.
Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons.++++@++++Hired goons?
And this is my basement.++++@++++Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon.++++@++++Which way to the bathroom?
Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left.++++@++++Nope. Nope. Nope.
Find the bathroom alright?++++@++++Uh... yeah.
A bug, I tell you! A bug!++++@++++I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
Because they love you down at the plant.++++@++++Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh...
That doesn't sound like they like you at all.++++@++++Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head.
Nay.++++@++++Who keeps saying that?
Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore.++++@++++Woo hoo!
SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT /++++@++++BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER...
All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.++++@++++Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!
Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind!++++@++++Haw haw. April Fool's.
You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you!++++@++++You talk better than you fool.
I'll fool you up real nice!++++@++++You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
P.U.++++@++++Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?
Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual.++++@++++God bless those pagans.
The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.++++@++++Happy New Year!
Dad! I was telling the story.++++@++++Oh, right.
I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.++++@++++Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will.
Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...++++@++++Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were.
Ay, no es bueno.++++@++++So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?
The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum.++++@++++Mmmm... beer.
Homie!++++@++++Marge!
...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--++++@++++Arrrgh!
Arrrgh!++++@++++Arrrgh!
I won't jump anymore, I promise.++++@++++Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.
I love you, Dad.++++@++++I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --
Right, Dad.++++@++++Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
It was an amusing episode... of our lives.++++@++++Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe.
I brought you a little present.++++@++++No! No! Beer bring pain!
Hey, what'll I tell the boss?++++@++++Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
You can do it, Homer. Stand up.++++@++++I can't.
He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him.++++@++++Mmm... chocolate.
Hi, Dr. Nick!++++@++++Oof.
Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?++++@++++No. Let me hear you play.
It was just an April Fool's joke.++++@++++Why, you little --
You lost five percent of your brain.++++@++++Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.++++@++++Marge, it happened again!
Gee, that's odd. They didn't send one to you.++++@++++Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.
Well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does.++++@++++I never passed remedial science one "A".
And you're a nuclear technician?++++@++++Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay.
What did you way?++++@++++I don't know. I flunked Latin, too.
Time to go to the reunion.++++@++++It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, "The Fonz"...
That was "Happy Days."++++@++++No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back.
Oh, it's you Simpson.++++@++++Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown.
I am not a crook.++++@++++Richard Nixon.
Jealous?++++@++++I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
I would.++++@++++Hmmm.
Grampa? Grampa?++++@++++The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave.
Okay, very good. Now, let's get on with our rilly big shew...++++@++++Ed Sullivan.
Homer Simpson!++++@++++Oh my God!
How'd you do it, Homer?++++@++++I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
And now, the award for most improved odor... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Yes!
And the person who traveled the least distance to be here... well, kiss my grits... Homer Simpson!++++@++++What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
It fell in the toilet.++++@++++Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!
Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect.++++@++++I never graduated from high school.
Hello, son! I was on my way home from work and thought I'd drop by.++++@++++Oh, you have a job?
They pay me eight hundred dollars a week to tell a cat and a mouse what to do.++++@++++I see.
Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute?++++@++++All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar.
Welcome to Remedial Science 1A. My uh wife recently passed away... I thought teaching might ease my loneliness.++++@++++Will this be on the test?
Now, I'm going to uh burn this donut to show you how many calories it has.++++@++++Nooooooo!
The bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet donut.++++@++++This is not happening. This is not happening.
All right, here are your exams. Fifty questions, true or false.++++@++++True.
Homer, I was just describing the test.++++@++++True.
Look, Homer, just take the test and you'll do fine.++++@++++False.
That's wonderful, Homie!++++@++++At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
HENS LOVE ROOSTERS/ GEESE LOVE GANDERS/ EVERYONE ELSE LOVES NED FLANDERS++++@++++Not me!
It's all so barbaric.++++@++++Hey kids. How was school?
I got expelled.++++@++++That's my boy.
Look, Dad. I don't need school. I'll make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guv'nor?++++@++++No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.
You're going to get an education. I'm going to teach you myself.++++@++++Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one.
Whacking Day is coming.++++@++++Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year.
But killing snakes is evil.++++@++++Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved.
Excuse me.++++@++++Whack! Whack! Whack!
Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it. Is there something wrong with me?++++@++++Yes, honey.
Then, what should I do?++++@++++Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?
Slow... then fast.++++@++++Uh-oh.
Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob.++++@++++Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?
That's right. Order now and you'll also get Sun `n' Run, the Suntan Lotion... that's also a laxative!++++@++++Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore.
Hey, dad. This came for you in the mail.++++@++++Woo-Hoo!
Who the devil are you?++++@++++My name is Mr. Burns.
There is no such thing.++++@++++Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head.
... Flintstones' chewable morphine.++++@++++I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
Morphine++++@++++Lobooo...
No offense, but we're putting that bitch on ice.++++@++++Now, come on! I'm your best customer.
No. In fact I can recite pi to 40,000 places. The last digit is one!++++@++++Mmm... pie.
I'll be fine, dear.++++@++++Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning.
Homer, I don't think this fish is quite dead yet.++++@++++Marge, please. I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters.
Who's gonna change Maggie?++++@++++We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course.
It seems like I've been wearing the same red dress forever.++++@++++Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.
Oh honey, I've missed you too. Homer, is that an old Halloween costume?++++@++++Uh... no.
Doggone it.++++@++++Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now. So I don't wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk...
Did you see that?++++@++++Yeah.
What's Gabbo?++++@++++I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.
I don't think they're giving you enough information, Dad.++++@++++I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
I can't believe it. Our first glimpse of Gabbo!++++@++++He'll tell us what to do.
Whoa! Me rikey velly much. Oh, I hope I didn't offend you. I need this bad.++++@++++WITH MY...
Dad...++++@++++Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues.
What?... What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'. I'm gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it?++++@++++Hey, Moe, can I look too?
Sure, but it'll cost ya.++++@++++My wallet's in the car.
Uh-oh.++++@++++Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out.
You've got to keep working on it.++++@++++Ooh, delicious.
It is, it really really is.++++@++++Ooh, five cents each!
Dad, when did you record an album?++++@++++I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago.
What are we all laughing about?++++@++++Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left "Saturday Night Live" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet...
Hello...++++@++++Hello...
HELLO, MA BABY / HELLO, MA HONEY / HELLO, MA RAGTIME, RAGTIME GAL / SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE... ETC.++++@++++Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild.
Barbershop! That ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit!++++@++++Bart, what did I tell you?
BA-BY ON BOARD.++++@++++Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. "Achy Breaky Heart" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop...
GOODBYE...++++@++++GOODBYE...
Homer, I'm a theatrical agent, and I want to represent your group.++++@++++Really?
You've got... it! All except that police officer. Too Village People. You'll have to replace him.++++@++++Just leave it to me.
Where are we going? Where are we going?++++@++++Run along, boy. You're free now!
OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM / EE-I-EE-I-O / AND ON THIS FARM HE HAD A CHICK / SWINGINGEST CHICK I KNOW / WITH A WIGGLE WIGGLE HERE AND A WIGGLE WIGGLE THERE...++++@++++Get off the stage!
JUST A LITTLE IRISH DITTY...++++@++++Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?
Perfect.++++@++++The Be Sharps.
I bought this cool pencil holder.++++@++++Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years.
No one bought a wishbone necklace.++++@++++Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire.
Look what I got. Now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.++++@++++Hmm... baby on board.
Gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one.++++@++++Wait'll I tell Marge!
Oh yes, Bouffant Betty. Well I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. You see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can.++++@++++Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.
Homer, you're going to be famous!++++@++++Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been.
Have you seen Bart?++++@++++I stuck him somewhere.
Damned ceremonies. This is time I could be working, Mommy.++++@++++We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons.
This enormous woman will devour us all!++++@++++I meant the statue.
Hello, Homer. I'm George Harrison.++++@++++Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie?
Over there. There's a big pile of 'em.++++@++++Oh man.
You beat Dexy's Midnight Runners!++++@++++Well, you haven't heard the last of them.
Miss you, Daddy.++++@++++I miss you too, honey.
Here's the champagne you ordered, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Oh. Thanks.
Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam...++++@++++They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!
What'd you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus?++++@++++All the time. It was the title of our second album!
So has Sinatra.++++@++++Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--
Ditto Tom Jones.++++@++++Shut up!
With your father on the road all the time I tried to compensate for his absence...++++@++++Hi, kids... I love
This is worse than your song about Mr. T.++++@++++I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney?
Gentlemen, US Magazine just came out with its "What's Hot and What's Not Issue."++++@++++Are we hot?
We are not.++++@++++We all went our separate ways.
Hey, Queenie, you can go now.++++@++++I'll give her a good home.
Since when could you write a song?++++@++++There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed.
... IT'S A TRIP TO PARADISE / WITH MY BA-BY... ON BOARD!++++@++++I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition.
Bart, what's wrong with you?++++@++++Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart.
Hmm. This one's done in different handwriting.++++@++++Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt.
But who'd want to hurt me? I'm this century's "Dennis the Menace."++++@++++It's probably the person you least suspect!
That man is so rude.++++@++++Yeah.
Oh I'll stay away from your son, all right. Stay away, forever.++++@++++Oh no!
Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without me knowing. And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal.++++@++++Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen?
Hiedilly-hey!++++@++++Go home.
... Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson, Lisa Simpson, that little baby Simpson. That is all.++++@++++Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh.
Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson, we've helped hundreds of people in danger. We'll give you a new name, a new job, new identities.++++@++++Ooh! I wanna be John Elway.
I don't think this is such a good idea.++++@++++This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah!++++@++++Shut up, boy.
We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville...++++@++++Ooh, Ice Creamville.
Tell you what sir, from now on you'll be Homer Thompson at Terror Lake. Let's just practice a bit. When I say "Hello, Mr. Thompson," you'll say, "Hi."++++@++++Check.
Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson.++++@++++I got ya.
Now when I say, "Hello, Mr. Thompson" and press down on your foot... you smile and nod.++++@++++No problem.
Hello, Mr. Thompson.++++@++++I think he's talking to you.
THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL ARE WE / PERT AS A SCHOOLGIRL WELL CAN BE / FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH GIRLISH GLEE / THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL...++++@++++EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...
Homer, where's the dog?++++@++++I tied him up, out back.
We've left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life?++++@++++Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left.
Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!++++@++++Bart! Don't interrupt!
Homer, this is serious.++++@++++Oh it is not.
Dad, I'm kinda edgy right now. I'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife.++++@++++Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy.
I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from "The HMS Pinafore."++++@++++Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.
Take him away, boys.++++@++++Aw, no fair.
Duh, Homer, why are we down here?++++@++++Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee.
But why?++++@++++You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.
Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick.++++@++++The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!
Homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. Now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.++++@++++What the hell are you talking about?
Relax, it's just a simulator. Nothing can go wrong.++++@++++Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
I like to put my feet up.++++@++++Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time.
Yes. He would.++++@++++So you want me to go to college?
College? Barber or clown?++++@++++Bart!
I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much.++++@++++Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way.
Homer, sign this application and you're a shoe-in.++++@++++That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!
Dad, don't let these application essays throw you. Let's see... "List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."++++@++++Is "TV Guide" a book?
You the man, Homer.++++@++++Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch...
I dunno, Dad. Don't you have a better picture?++++@++++Relax, a photo can't make any difference.
Ah... steakey.++++@++++Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch.
Oh, don't worry, I've expelled those rowdy members of Chug-a-lug House.++++@++++I hate that lousy dean!
G-rrrrr!++++@++++Yes! Take that, Bitterman!
Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?++++@++++Something I should have done a long time ago...
You don't know, do you?++++@++++No, ma'am.
Three days.++++@++++Nerd!
Homer, that isn't very nice.++++@++++Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.
Hi there, hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby. I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, I'm always up for some Hackey Sack. Or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass player for "The Pretenders."++++@++++Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt.
Good morning and welcome to Nuclear Physics 101. I see a lot of new faces, but you know the old saying, "Out with the old, in with the nucleus!"++++@++++Hold me.
Now, we'll begin by - oops...++++@++++You see that, sir. Drops his notes.
Now, if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class.++++@++++Do we have to?
Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.++++@++++Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site.
This proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it...++++@++++Uh, excuse me "Professor Brainiac," but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works.
Well please, come down and show us.++++@++++All right, I will.
Homer, no one blames you for the accident. We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. I researched these names myself...++++@++++Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over.
Hello?++++@++++Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head.
Stop the Humanoid!++++@++++Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor...
We are the Knights who say Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!++++@++++Heh heh. "Nee."
Listen to yourself, man. You're hangin' with nerds.++++@++++You take that back...
Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds.++++@++++Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table.++++@++++I'll write it on my hand...
Ho. Including all known Lanthanides and Actinides? Good luck!++++@++++C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!
If you're going for a ride I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.++++@++++But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good...
The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they're our best target.++++@++++Those bastards...
Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot...++++@++++And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
Mr. Simpson, I don't think he likes that.++++@++++Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly...
Huh, I can't believe that worked.++++@++++Hey, that's not the wallet inspector.
It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?++++@++++Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?
You really think you can get us back into college?++++@++++Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
Why does it have to be zany?++++@++++I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
Prank?++++@++++And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.
Well, I'm touched by your honesty. And who knows, perhaps I've been a bit of an ogre myself.++++@++++Yes, you have.
We really want to thank you, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends.
So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam.++++@++++Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams.
What are you gonna do Mr. Simpson?++++@++++Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.
Or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before.++++@++++Whatever. Either way is good...
Aw, man, I can't believe you failed.++++@++++I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
Mr. Simpson, there is a way. We could... well, use a computer to change your grade.++++@++++Computers can do that?
Oh yes. The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires...++++@++++Mora wuza?
An "A plus"! How did you do it?++++@++++Oh, let's just say I had help from a "little magic box..."
Way to go, dad!++++@++++Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.
No we didn't.++++@++++Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.++++@++++Hmmm, true.
And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating.++++@++++Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean.
Par-ty down?++++@++++Yes.
What? Homie!++++@++++Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
Where is that dreaded piÃ±ata?++++@++++Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!
What are you doin'?++++@++++I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.++++@++++Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants.
Does either of you know what incontinent means?++++@++++Lisa, don't spoil our fun!
Come on dear. It's time to go.++++@++++Okay, stupid!
Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.++++@++++Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!
And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!++++@++++Are you ready to laugh?
Oh... That poor dog.++++@++++I said are you ready to laugh?!
Quiet, you awful man!++++@++++You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap...
What!++++@++++I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
How dare you!++++@++++Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky.
Destroy him.++++@++++Blah, bla...
Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.++++@++++Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.++++@++++Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.
Bobo. It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.++++@++++Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.
No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.++++@++++Yes. We'll send the eye.
As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding.++++@++++Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
May I offer you a drink?++++@++++Sorry, Burns. No deal.
How much do you want?++++@++++A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones.
Done. Now, give me that bear.++++@++++Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.
You've made a mistake, Simpson.++++@++++Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay.
Have you been up all night eating cheese?++++@++++I think I'm blind.
Excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money.++++@++++Right here.
Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.++++@++++My life can't get any worse.
Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties.++++@++++After lunch can I whip you?
I think we need a new hairdryer.++++@++++Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.
I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.++++@++++Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul.
TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR....++++@++++I can see why this is so popular.
What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?++++@++++That's right.
Homer, give him what he wants.++++@++++Oh, Barney, leave me alone.
Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse?++++@++++Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!
Please... please.++++@++++But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's.
Eh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.++++@++++Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?
And next in our fall catalogue: we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream.++++@++++Oooh, pure genius...
Well, that can be arranged.++++@++++Flanders! You're the devil?
It's always the one you least suspect! Now many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifica...++++@++++Do you have a donut or not?
Now remember: the instant you finish it, I own your soul for --++++@++++Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
Technically no, but --++++@++++I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-
You are not smarter than me! I'll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson!++++@++++Not likely. Heh, heh.
Homer?! Did you eat that donut?++++@++++No.
Oh you Americans with your due process and fair trials. This is always so much easier in Mexico. All right. Very well. We'll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. 'Til then, you're going to spend the day in hell.++++@++++Eh, that wasn't so bad.
So, you like donuts, eh?++++@++++Uh, huh.
Well! Have all the donuts in the world!!++++@++++More. Mmmm.
Homer! Are you all right?++++@++++No.
Homer, stop picking at it.++++@++++But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work.
Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. Don't worry, honey, the scary part's over.++++@++++Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!
We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.++++@++++They're dogs! And they're playing poker!
A vampire!++++@++++Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.
Precious blood.++++@++++Hmmm... business deal.
Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?++++@++++Sure did.
Dad, do you notice anything strange?++++@++++Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.
I heard that!++++@++++It was the boy!
Eww, Dad, this is blood.++++@++++Correction. Free blood.
Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence.++++@++++Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is.
Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here.++++@++++Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.
The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns.++++@++++Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?
This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.++++@++++Super Fun Happy Slide!
No, Dad.++++@++++I guess killing will be fun enough.
You must drive this stake right through his heart.++++@++++Take that, vile fiend!
Uh, Dad, that's his crotch.++++@++++Oh, sorry.
But, no, we killed Mr. Burns.++++@++++You have to kill the head vampire.
Maybe it's the TV.++++@++++Stupid TV. Be more funny.
What the hell...? Oooh, we got a call.++++@++++Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!
I'd like to pledge thirty dollars. Oh, thank you!++++@++++Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?
They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.++++@++++The ballet? Woo hoo!
You like ballet?++++@++++Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet.
That's one right there.++++@++++All right, but remember it's mine.
Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum.
Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?++++@++++I can't. I gotta take my wife to the ballet.
Gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?++++@++++Mmmm... invisible cola.
Hey careful there, Homer. I heard somebody lost an arm in there once.++++@++++Phht, that's just an old wives tale.
Let's get outta here!++++@++++Must... get to ballet...
Homer, this is never easy to say. I'm gonna have to saw your arms off.++++@++++They'll grow back, right?
Homer, are you just holding onto the can?++++@++++Your point being?
"Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."++++@++++Lumber has a million uses.
I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers. In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.++++@++++Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.
Heh, heh. Oh Marge, we should do this every Thursday.++++@++++Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!
What's so special about it?++++@++++What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called "Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman"?!
I don't know.++++@++++When will you be home?
I'm not sure.++++@++++Where you going?
You already asked me that.++++@++++Will you bring me back something?
Don't wait up.++++@++++How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?
Rock the Casbah!++++@++++Man's best friend, indeed.
I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much.++++@++++Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?
Sure Dad.++++@++++That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter.++++@++++Oh Lisa, haven't you seen "Home Alone?" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter.++++@++++Wait a second...
Blast that infernal card! Don't give that card to me.++++@++++Here you g... Nnnnnno.
Mr. Simpson. I was just going through your garbage and I couldn't help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. Of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.++++@++++We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.
Three.++++@++++Two.
Okay, two. And I get to keep this old bird cage.++++@++++Done.
Homer, stop that! It's just a weather station.++++@++++Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!
What are you doing here?++++@++++My wife's having a girls' night out.
We're in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair.++++@++++A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak.
That's exactly how Dillinger got started.++++@++++Really?
Mmmm, engine block eggs. If we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty.++++@++++That's them!
Oh no, they're headed right for the Grand Chasm.++++@++++Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
Homer?!++++@++++Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.
You're right. I am lucky to have him.++++@++++But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!
Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.++++@++++Solid waste, I could kiss you.
Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army neuro-chemical research center at Fort Meade Maryland for extensive testing.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him.++++@++++Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
Why do you read that "Free" column, Homer? They never have anything good.++++@++++OH MY GOD!
What is it?++++@++++Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!
Hey! That seltzer ain't free.++++@++++Krusty!
That's me. You here for the trampoline?++++@++++Yeah. What's the deal?
Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. There once was a man named Enos --++++@++++And I can just haul it away? Free?
You're a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha?++++@++++Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son.
I don't know if this is a good idea.++++@++++Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!
Are you sure it's safe?++++@++++Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
It smells funny in there.++++@++++No it doesn't!
Stop jumping on me! I'm hurt!++++@++++Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.
Homer, this is terrible!++++@++++Okay, okay. I'll take care of it.
I told you this was a bad idea!++++@++++All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!
You just keep right on drivin'.++++@++++There we go.
Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?++++@++++Uh-huh.
Let's jump on the car instead.++++@++++Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!
That's not true.++++@++++Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes...++++@++++That's not fun!
Um... Uh, well... Uh...++++@++++See, Marge?
I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.++++@++++Marge, can I go outside and play?
That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script.++++@++++And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad.++++@++++Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.++++@++++And I feel that you hear my shame.
I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.++++@++++I feel validated by that.
Good. I'm glad we had this talk.++++@++++Me too.
Brad Goodman is coming to town!++++@++++Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?
We know, Dad.++++@++++I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.
Food goes in here.++++@++++It sure does!
That means no, eh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama, Papa -- could you come up here?++++@++++Thank you. Very, very much.
Arr! This picture'll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.++++@++++This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.
I didn't feel like it.++++@++++Hey, I hear ya, buddy.
Eep.++++@++++Hey, boy! In here!
They're headin' for the old mill!++++@++++No, we're not.
No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.++++@++++That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
You tell me, Chief. You had a pretty good view from behind your desk.++++@++++Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain.
What does that mean, exactly?++++@++++It means he gets results, you stupid chief.
Dad, sit down.++++@++++Oh, I'm sorry.
Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner.++++@++++Steak?
Money's too tight for steak.++++@++++Steak?
Sure, steak.++++@++++Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
It's a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!!++++@++++Mmmmm... free goo.
I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... "uncool," but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies.++++@++++Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel.
They won't let you have any fun.++++@++++Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons.
Homer, you should be more supportive.++++@++++You're right, Marge. Good work, boy.
Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?++++@++++Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart.
Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip.++++@++++Heh heh. You don't have a son.
Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me!++++@++++Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!
Arrr, here be a fine vessel. The yarest river-goin' boat there be.++++@++++I'll take it.
Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft.++++@++++Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.
Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought?++++@++++Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible.
Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--?++++@++++So many Krustyburger locations.
Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current.++++@++++Wrong again, Flanders.
Hey! I got that for my birthday!++++@++++Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope.++++@++++Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? "Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."
Homer! No!++++@++++Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!
Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die.++++@++++Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!
Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?++++@++++Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing.
STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!++++@++++Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.
A rescue plane! Get the flare gun!++++@++++This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing...
Come back! Come back! Oh, we're done for! We're done for! We're Done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily...++++@++++Flanders! Snap out of it!
Dad, I think he's oka--++++@++++It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.
You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food.++++@++++You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
Godspeed, li'l doodle.++++@++++He'll be back.
A real Swiss army knife. Cool!++++@++++I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug.++++@++++Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...
Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence.++++@++++The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.
Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too.++++@++++According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!++++@++++Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!
Close the damn thing down! No one's ever gonna come.++++@++++Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!
You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father.++++@++++Go away. Eating.
And we can't take off our pants when it gets real hot.++++@++++And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
Yeah, ditto.++++@++++Hi.
Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?++++@++++Gotta go.
Have a good night, Homer.++++@++++You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.
Seems okay. Anybody see the game last night?++++@++++Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice.
Yeah, usually you just take the box of donuts into the bathroom.++++@++++Mindy has a motorcycle.
Hey, Joey Joe Joe!++++@++++Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?
"Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."++++@++++Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?
Can't talk... eating.++++@++++Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze.
Double glaze.++++@++++Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV.
Not me. That's my idea of heaven.++++@++++Me too.
Really? I can see I'm gonna love working with you. Well, gotta go. I wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch.++++@++++Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too.
I guess we'll be going down together. I mean getting off together. I mean...++++@++++That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.
Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts.++++@++++Well, this is my floor.
Hi, Hober. Dote kiss be, I'b all stuffed up.++++@++++Uhhh.
Hi, Dad.++++@++++Hi, son. Howya... ewww.
Dad, look, I made fish sticks. They're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out.++++@++++Yeah, good.
That raccoon stole my lamb chop.++++@++++Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me.
Oh that's sweet. Guess what. There's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a T-shirt. I got two dollars off because mine got smeared.++++@++++Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.
Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?++++@++++Nooo!
Homer, I'm your guardian angel. I've assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - Sir Isaac Newton.++++@++++Sir Isa-who?
Oh, very well.++++@++++Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?
I'm not actually Col. Klink. I'm just assuming his form.++++@++++Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?
I'm so happy, darling.++++@++++I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?
Yes, sir. Quite.++++@++++Then we're all happy.
Sure, life is good for you, but what about Marge?++++@++++Marge lives here?
Dad, why are you singing?++++@++++Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It's not much, but it's a start.
Are you hiding something from me?++++@++++Like what?
Judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named Mindy... or a man named Andy.++++@++++Lisa, look out behind you!
Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that.++++@++++No, Lisa, I swear to you. I'm one-hundred percent completely serious. You've got to turn around right now before it's too late.
Hi, Homer.++++@++++Mindy!
Come on, I'll get you the tickets.++++@++++Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?
What is it? Do you have a question?++++@++++Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
Free shower curtain!++++@++++Mindy?
Wow, if it weren't for this wall we'd be sleeping in the same bed.++++@++++Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. Heh heh.
Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.++++@++++Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!++++@++++Oh!
I can't believe we ordered so much.++++@++++Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed.
No more Chernobyls!++++@++++Go to hell!
And now the moment you've been waiting for. This year's King and Queen of Energy are... Homer Simpson and Mindy Simmons!++++@++++Huh?
Homer, Mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone, at Madame Chao's, the sexiest Chinese restaurant in Capital City!++++@++++Is there any way to get out of this?
What a perfect evening. It was sure nice of them to make us cheeseburgers.++++@++++Oh yeah.
This was a really nice night, Homer.++++@++++Yeah, yeah.
Oh... well, we don't have to.++++@++++Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
Well, desserts aren't always right.++++@++++But they're so sweet.
Homer, you don't have to do anything you don't want to.++++@++++Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to...
Hey, there's a turkey behind the bed.++++@++++Mmmm... Marge.
Dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.++++@++++Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.
This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.++++@++++And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.
Dad, what do you think?++++@++++Shhh. I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
Hey! I said bug off!++++@++++Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again.
Yee ha! Homer, I want you to have my lucky hat. I wore it the day Kennedy was shot, and it allllways brings me good luck!++++@++++Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over.
Hi, Homie.++++@++++Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.
I was for the casino!++++@++++Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory.
For you. It's the President.++++@++++Y'ello?
Definitely have to leave the table.++++@++++No! Please, please, please, please, please...
Gotta watch Wapner. Leave the table. Yeah, leave the table.++++@++++No!
Ewww!++++@++++Marge, you waited for me.
I'll catch up to you.++++@++++Marge, I'm taking the car.
I'll walk.++++@++++This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
Go home. You're bad luck!++++@++++Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that's just sad.
There's nothing to eat for breakfast.++++@++++You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust.
Maybe Mom just doesn't realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know.++++@++++Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom.
I won sixty dollars last night.++++@++++Woo hoo! Problem solved!
Mommm!++++@++++Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?
I just had a bad dream.++++@++++Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it.
Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the Boogeyman was after me and he's hiding...++++@++++Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!
What happened here?++++@++++Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid.
Dad, Mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the Geography Pageant is tonight.++++@++++Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey.
But Dad, if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida, I'll be the laughing stock of the whole school.++++@++++It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this.
I'm not a state, I'm a monster!++++@++++No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws.
Think before you say each word.++++@++++You broke a promise to your child.
Lisa's costume. Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.++++@++++Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
You know, you're right, Homer. Maybe I should get some professional help.++++@++++No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore.
That's true. Will you forgive me?++++@++++Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?
Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that.++++@++++Aw, what a gyp.
Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone.++++@++++Woo hoo!
And my necklace.++++@++++Eh, that's no big loss.
Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.++++@++++Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.
Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself.++++@++++Shhh, quiet Lisa.
Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance.++++@++++Curse you, Magic Beans.
Oh, stop blaming the beans.++++@++++Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!
Ow, my jugular! Any questions?++++@++++Let me check my reason list.
And don't take candy from strangers.++++@++++Marge, they're only human.
What's the point of all these precautions? I've already lost the only thing that matters to me.++++@++++Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument.
What, this jug?++++@++++Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down.
Thank you.++++@++++You know Lisa, music helps daddy think.
Hey, you're that drunken posse. Wow, can I join you?++++@++++I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
Yeah! Someone else! Someone else! Someone else!++++@++++I'm someone else!
He's right!++++@++++We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences.
I'll join! I'm filled with piss and vinegar. At first I was just filled with vinegar...++++@++++Sorry, Dad. You're too old.
And a fine job ye did too!++++@++++Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are...
I don't think the guns are a good idea, Homer.++++@++++Marge, we're responsible adults and...
Oops.++++@++++... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
So, wedding, huh?++++@++++No, we're forming a vigilante group.
Radiant cool crazy nightmare. Zen New Jersey nowhere.++++@++++Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
How now brown bureaucrats.++++@++++Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
Hey, see this sign?++++@++++Sorry.
Meaning what exactly?++++@++++You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big.
It's not just a megaphone, Dad. It's a RapMaster 2000.++++@++++Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
It's Hammer!++++@++++Return to your homes and places of businesses!
Sears.++++@++++Get him!
I got one.++++@++++Too late.
It makes me feel like a big man.++++@++++You're in. Here's the sack.
Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?++++@++++I 'unno. Coast Guard?
And I still don't have my saxophone.++++@++++Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas.
World domination?++++@++++Oh, that might be a typo.
Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent?++++@++++Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.
I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?++++@++++Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.
Hello, Kent. Hello, Homer, my arch nemesis.++++@++++Y'ello.
Uh, you do realize who this is...++++@++++Uh... Marge?
No, Homer, I'm not your wife, although I do enjoy her pearls. As a matter of fact, I'm holding them right now. Listen.++++@++++Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
Homer, that's our stage manager!++++@++++Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia.++++@++++Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.
Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg.++++@++++Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything.
Any sign of the burglar yet?++++@++++He'll show.
How's that?++++@++++It's his job.
I believe you, Dad.++++@++++Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do.
You let me down, man. Now I don't believe in nothing no more. I'm going to law school.++++@++++Nooooo!
Dad, maybe this will cheer you up.++++@++++Oh, this doesn't work any more.
I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.++++@++++Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.
What an eyesore.++++@++++So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him.
Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you.++++@++++Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.
I suppose you're wondering where I hid all the millions of dollars I stole over the years.++++@++++Shut up.
It's buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T.++++@++++No kidding.
Big T, huh?++++@++++Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep.
It's just a piece of paper.++++@++++It's mine!
Uh, how're we gonna get outta here?++++@++++We'll dig our way out!
Why are you so happy?++++@++++Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge.
I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.++++@++++That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!
Well...++++@++++Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.
Hey, Pepe, go for the face!++++@++++Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.
Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job.++++@++++Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig.
That's for taking credit for other people's work.++++@++++It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters.
Thanks Dad, that's great advice.++++@++++Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today.
But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot. And the last two chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.++++@++++Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.
Obnoxious fad?++++@++++Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid.
I'm doing the Conan O'Brien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.++++@++++Don't forget to say "I didn't do it".
Dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase.++++@++++How do you figure boy?
Watch the Conan O'Brien show. You'll see.++++@++++All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know.
One at a time! No Teamsters!++++@++++That dog can sell anything.
If anyone wants me I'll be in my room.++++@++++What kind of catchphrase is that?
Well, this time I've gone too far. No, no one will fall for...++++@++++Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
I'm so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.++++@++++This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
Okay, ten pounds.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: "Geezers in Freezers." It turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term "Geezers." Now coming up next, "The Case of the Cantankerous Old Geezer."++++@++++Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number...++++@++++Bor-ing.
Dad, are you listening to me?++++@++++Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking.
All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?++++@++++No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire.
All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?++++@++++Oh, that I'll wear.
Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet.++++@++++Bee? Aah!
Hot diggity dog! We've got him, Mr. Simpson. Now lets -- Mr. Simpson?++++@++++One hot dog please.
Yo, check this out. Black guys drive a car like this. Yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this.++++@++++It's true, it's true. We're so lame.
Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village this is the traditional pose of apology.++++@++++Oh.
You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends. At first I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt. I am at your service.++++@++++You're selling what now?
I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.++++@++++You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
Yes, he's raking leaves.++++@++++What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...
If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him.++++@++++Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?
I can see through time.++++@++++Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?
A napkin.++++@++++Outrageous.
Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. What the...?++++@++++Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.
And he taught me how to play the shenai.++++@++++That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
Thank you all for the kind praise.++++@++++Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
MAGGIE WITH HER EYES SO BRIGHT / MARGE WITH HAIR BY FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT / LISA CAN PHILOSOPHIZE / BART'S ADEPT AT SPINNING LIES / HOMER'S A DELIGHTFUL FELLA / SORRY 'BOUT THE SALMONELLA.++++@++++That's okay.
LET'S HURL A BRICKY-MART!++++@++++THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .
NOT ME!++++@++++Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.
I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.++++@++++And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART? I DO.++++@++++Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that.
I must go to the head office and appeal my case.++++@++++I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along.
But, sir, the head office is in India.++++@++++Okay.
Dad... That's over ten thousand miles away.++++@++++I'm aware of that.
There she is, there she is, the world's first convenience store.++++@++++This isn't very convenient.
That's great, because all I need is one.++++@++++Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Thank you, come again.++++@++++Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
How did it go?++++@++++Fine. Oh, I mean not good.
Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.++++@++++Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
Yes... yes, a movie, yes.++++@++++Hey, let's all hug Apu.
Awww.++++@++++Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again.
And to my son, Homer...++++@++++Woo hoo!
Ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. And one day, I seen J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by, so I run out of the house with a big washtub and... Where're you goin'?++++@++++Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them.
That toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie.++++@++++Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too...
All right, come on, pops. Soldiers won't bother you anymore.++++@++++ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!..
Boo!++++@++++Thank you, thank you very much!
Hm. I don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.++++@++++Marge, that's what I bought it for!
Why are you people avoiding me? Does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?++++@++++Yes. But there's more.
Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade.++++@++++And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.
It's rotten being old. No one listens to ya.++++@++++I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are.
Dad, did you hear something?++++@++++I'unno.
Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa! Kudos!++++@++++Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to.
Except forrrrr...++++@++++Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time.
Yeah, how come?++++@++++Union rule twenty-six - "Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."
I'm sorry, Homie.++++@++++Nobody respects me at work.
Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull.++++@++++What, what does it say? I want to see.
Unbelievable! And just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. And of course this could have literally millions of applications here on Earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.++++@++++Boring.
And we laugh legitimately. There's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.++++@++++Make it stop!
Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!++++@++++I can't! I can't!
God, I wish there was an easier way.++++@++++Hello, is this NASA?
How did you get this number?++++@++++Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.
Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?++++@++++No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him.
Well, welcome aboard. I think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends.++++@++++Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE.
Uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?++++@++++I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell.
Careful, they're ruffled!++++@++++I'll take care of this.
No, not that far from shame.++++@++++Less shame?
You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do.++++@++++Who's doin' what now?
I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL / I'VE INFORMATION VEGETABLE, ANIMAL, AND MINERAL.++++@++++Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket
So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.++++@++++Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition.
There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.++++@++++You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. But in another more accurate way, Barney is the winner.++++@++++Congratulations, Barney.
Well, Homer. I guess you're the winner by default.++++@++++Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-
Homer, you already dialed.++++@++++Oh.
But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life.++++@++++Ants!
Mission control, this is Corvair, launch sequence initiated. All systems go.++++@++++Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.
Some good news, gentlemen, we have quite a treat for ya. We've been able to coax superstar James Taylor in here at mission control to wish you well and play a little of his own brand of laid back adult contemporary music.++++@++++Wow! Former president James Taylor.
All right, here we go: three, two, one, make hatch blow...now!++++@++++And that is that.
With that hatch open, we'll burn up on reentry. That's it! If I go, I'm taking you to hell with me.++++@++++Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.
Wait, Homer. If that bar holds, we just might make it back to earth.++++@++++I'll bash you good.
Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.++++@++++Stupid rod. I got gypped.
Yeah, Dad. How many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?++++@++++Yeah, maybe I do have the right... what's that stuff? Anyway, thanks, Marge, Lisa.
Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks.++++@++++Woo hoo! Sold!
Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer.++++@++++What do you mean? It says right here: "Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center." Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig.
With the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper.++++@++++In theory, yes. Jerk.
That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, "I'm Worried, Need Money!" Okay, if you want two tickets to the big Pigskin Classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller!++++@++++Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
Ned Flanders...++++@++++Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders.
I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / WON'T YOU PACK YOUR BAGS TO LEAVE TONIGHT /++++@++++I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...
What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.++++@++++Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts.
Oooh, the walls are melting again.++++@++++God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game.
Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic...++++@++++Why do you mock me, oh Lord?
Homer, that's not God, that's just a waffle that Bart tossed up there.++++@++++I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.
Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?++++@++++Y- No.
Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?++++@++++Well, yeah.
Wow, these are amazing seats, huh Homer?++++@++++Yeah.
What the hell happened to my dogs? I want answers.++++@++++Well, I guess I should pay my share...
Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest.++++@++++Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned.
Stan, Stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will.++++@++++We won! We won! Flanders, we won!
Heh-heh, yeah.++++@++++Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!
Hidilly ho, Stanster.++++@++++You know Stan Taylor?
Know me? Ned Flanders saved me. I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more.++++@++++Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
Sure. Anything for Neddie. Here you go.++++@++++Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called "Stitch-face." Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again.++++@++++No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!
Homer, that's our wedding photo.++++@++++Marge, quit livin' in the past.
Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl.++++@++++I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table.++++@++++Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.
That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?++++@++++Boring. Let's watch something else.
Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch.++++@++++Yeah.
Good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle Homer.++++@++++Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family.
Honey, I'm so glad you're home--++++@++++Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.
...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house.++++@++++Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?
Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work.++++@++++Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya.
Oh, you poor, unfortunate man. Let's get you out of those clothes immediately. And we'll do whatever we can about the smell.++++@++++But... all right.
Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight.++++@++++Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays.
...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women.++++@++++Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that.
Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too.++++@++++Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.
That was you!++++@++++Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love.
Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly...++++@++++The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
No way, JosÃ© !++++@++++Yes way.
WELL\WELL\WELL...W-W-W-WELL\WELL\WELL...++++@++++Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot.
How are my boys doin', Homer?++++@++++They're fine.
Lies made baby Jesus cry.++++@++++I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.
Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--++++@++++Food fight!
We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.++++@++++Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship.++++@++++Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?
Oh! Almost. Boy that was close.++++@++++Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?
Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know?++++@++++Right, no reporters.
No, I-I mean just the Flanders family.++++@++++O-okay.
I can't, it's a Geo!++++@++++Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.
I think we should leave.++++@++++Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats.
Before I get started on today's sermon entitled , "What Ned Did," I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work.++++@++++I live to give.
Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend.++++@++++Right back atcha, buddy.
Hi-diddly ho, neighbor.++++@++++Get lost, Flanders.
Okilly-dokilly.++++@++++See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't...
Hi, Mom.++++@++++Hi, Mom.
Eeeeeee!!++++@++++I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.
Think you'll win?++++@++++Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get.
Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.++++@++++Push her down, son.
I think you'll find that escape is impossible. Now each one of you take a floor and get started.++++@++++I call the basement.
Amen, Ernie.++++@++++All done.
You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.++++@++++Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories.
Shazam!++++@++++Shazam.
Stop remembering TV and get back to work.++++@++++What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?
Wah-wah.++++@++++Use only in a well ventilated area.
Homer, what's going on down there?++++@++++Nothing.
Then stop screaming so loud.++++@++++Okay.
Well, hot dog! We have a "wiener"!++++@++++Y'ello?
Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.++++@++++He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
I want the elephant.++++@++++Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!
You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. Which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.++++@++++Lisa, go to your room.
Homer, it looks like it could gore.++++@++++Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.
I really think this is a bad idea.++++@++++Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.++++@++++What's he yelling about?
You ate it too fast.++++@++++Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel.++++@++++Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel.
I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.++++@++++Shut up.
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live.++++@++++Plants, eh?
Strip the bark now, Stampy.++++@++++Hey, any more arboretums around here?
No, Dad. He's grooming him.++++@++++Grooming him, eh?
Ew, Homer, there is a bird on your head?++++@++++I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.++++@++++Hey, what's with them?
I think they're trying to get some attention.++++@++++Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. "Chain for elephant," "Shots for elephant"... "Oversized decorative poncho".
Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.++++@++++Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.++++@++++Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
We'll pay you money.++++@++++For the ninth time, no!
Uh, here's a better sign, Dad.++++@++++I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son.
Stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.++++@++++Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.
Yes. But we paid you four dollars.++++@++++Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.
Get off our property.++++@++++This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend!++++@++++Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
Well sir, I'll be honest with you. I need a large African elephant. And I need it today. But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm lookin' for.++++@++++What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?
Well it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.++++@++++He likes peanuts.
It's perfect, Dad.++++@++++I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me.
Well we really can't offer you any money. We're a non-profit organization.++++@++++So, your bid is zero.
Well, we like to think of it as --++++@++++Thank you.
You know I really think --++++@++++Thank you.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.++++@++++Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend.++++@++++Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant.
I'll take that one, too.++++@++++Done.
All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.++++@++++Here's the keys.
Elephants don't have keys.++++@++++I'll just keep these then.
I'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.++++@++++He took Bart too?
A female deer.++++@++++Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...
Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.++++@++++Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?++++@++++I'd like it fine.
Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?++++@++++Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene...
Dad! You're sinking!++++@++++Huh?
Get a rope, Bart!++++@++++Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Ow!++++@++++I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Ow! My hair!++++@++++Mmm. Caramel.
Congratulations Homer Simpson! You've just won the employee raffle!++++@++++Woo hoo! What do I get?
The job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!++++@++++Woo hoo!
So much for Plan B.++++@++++That's it, boy. You're our last hope.
I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. Ah, one more.++++@++++Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in.
Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick.++++@++++Oooh. He card reads good.
So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns.++++@++++It's KURNS, stupid!
Excellent.++++@++++The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?++++@++++There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great.
Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.++++@++++Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet.++++@++++Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything...
Well, I --++++@++++Boo!
I'm okay.++++@++++Oh, yeah. So good...
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?++++@++++Yeah, let's push him down the steps.
All right.++++@++++How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
Homer, say something.++++@++++Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs.++++@++++That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.++++@++++Bart, you listen.
Oh, go eat some flowers.++++@++++My secret shame.
Ugh! Smithers get it off me.++++@++++Bart, you're coming home.
I suggest you leave immediately.++++@++++Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst.
That was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of "Wings."++++@++++You idiot! He was the most talented one!
Homer, that's Hans Moleman.++++@++++Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?
Let me try one.++++@++++Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!
Hurry! Fire him now or I'll disown you. You'll lose everything. The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video, the freedom to do whatever you want.++++@++++I'll miss you, son.
How do you know?++++@++++Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
I love you guys.++++@++++Right back atcha, son. Aw.
Cowabunga, dudes.++++@++++Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, I guess it is guilt.++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?
Well, yeah, but --++++@++++Well, I'm off to work.
The dog has had enough excitement.++++@++++But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement.
...with your new principal, Ned Flanders!++++@++++How many "s"'s in "innocent"?
Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.++++@++++That is true.
Can't let Dad see me playing hooky.++++@++++I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
Good afternoon.++++@++++How do you do, sir?
I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say.++++@++++I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Give those glasses to the bailiff.++++@++++All right.
Will the jury retire and come to its decision?++++@++++Okay, fine.
We might as well make it official.++++@++++What does sequestered mean?
If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.++++@++++What does deadlocked mean?
It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.++++@++++Uh-huh. And "if"?
A conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition that."++++@++++So "if" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be "deadlocked" and have to be "sequestered" in the Springfield Palace Hotel.
Let's vote. My liver is failing.++++@++++Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, "Free Willy!"
Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote.++++@++++Uh, how are the rest of you voting?
You know, we're kind of like the original "Odd Couple." You're the messy one and I'm...++++@++++Shut up.
Ew, What a mess.++++@++++I don't like this new director's cut.
You're stealing a table?++++@++++I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.
Ah. Is that my necktie you're wearing?++++@++++Souvenir.
Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.++++@++++Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it.
Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake.++++@++++What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
Hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! I made a special cake for you to ruin. It's over there.++++@++++Ooh.
It's been great spending time with my family again. I guess the next time I see you won't be until Thanksgiving.++++@++++Or, if not then, Christmas.
Homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.++++@++++Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny.
Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. "Periodicals," that's it.++++@++++Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?!++++@++++Oh.
Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness.++++@++++Not at all.
Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother.++++@++++Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!
Bart! Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa being in love?++++@++++If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!
Hot diggity! I'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! I even bought me some special novelty dentures.++++@++++Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool.
Oh, I see. SO IF I TAKE YOUR ADVICE / AND MAKE YOUR PATENTED MOVE / THEN MY CHANCES FOR LOVE / WILL SLIGHTLY IMPROVE?++++@++++NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?
Whoop-de-doo, employees! Everyone who's found true love may leave early today!++++@++++All right!
Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.++++@++++Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him.
Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates.++++@++++Yabba-dabba-doo!
He's an awful, awful, awful man, but I guess if he makes Mom happy, that's all that really matters.++++@++++That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys.
Dad, I'm really sorry, but I charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card.++++@++++What?!
Don't worry, here's the cash.++++@++++Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of "Nightline"!
Evil-schmevil, Marge. Monty can provide for me, and besides, he's a great kisser.++++@++++Ew yuuuuck!
Homer, do you want any cards? Homer?++++@++++Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called "chips."
Do you want another card or not?++++@++++Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
I'm in. Let's see your cards.++++@++++I was bluffing.
Hey, don't yell at Homer. Just because he's a little slow...++++@++++How dare you call me that?!
We don't think you're slow. But, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.++++@++++You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!
Oh Homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.++++@++++Take another bath in malt liquor?
... There's that. Or, you could take an adult education course.++++@++++Oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?
That's because you were drunk!++++@++++And how.
Gettin' better!++++@++++Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him.
What is your area of expertise?++++@++++Well... I can tell the difference between butter and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."
No you can't, Mr. Simpson. No one can.++++@++++I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?
Oh, you're married?++++@++++That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket.++++@++++Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.
I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more Socratic method of interactive class participation?++++@++++Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher.
Well, Homer, what a pleasant...++++@++++Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach.
Can I take your order?++++@++++Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!
Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.++++@++++It's all right! I'm a teacher.
Simpson!++++@++++Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny.
You were not! You were just eating a damn orange!++++@++++Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange.
I don't understand.++++@++++Okay. But then we've got to get to work.
He's a horrible excuse for an educator.++++@++++I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
So something wasn't working in bed, huh?++++@++++No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money.
Trouble in paradise, huh? DERISIVE LAUGH)++++@++++I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
Marge dyes her hair?++++@++++Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.++++@++++Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.
Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.++++@++++Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say.
Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy.++++@++++Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.
Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again.++++@++++Yes ma'am.
Tell us more about you and Marge.++++@++++This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things.
I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course! What the heck was that lab fee for?++++@++++No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds.
Oh, all right. / Okay.++++@++++Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.
We need names!++++@++++Well let's just call 'em uh, "Mr. X" and "Mrs. Y." So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'
Homer, don't you have to get to class?++++@++++Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.
What the darn...?++++@++++Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.
Apparently that disturbing odor was the food.++++@++++So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?
I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.++++@++++And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?
Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.++++@++++Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double dared us.++++@++++Why you little...
Me too.++++@++++Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed...
Get out! Get out! Get out!++++@++++All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.
You, too.++++@++++Huh?
Get out!++++@++++But I'm not in the cla...
You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore.++++@++++But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.
Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha? Ha.++++@++++Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.
Affirmative, humanoid.++++@++++Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.
Sorry, Bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend scared.++++@++++Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains.
Funny... the way everything reminds me of Homer.++++@++++I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...
Here, Dad. I brought you some nice...++++@++++Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.
Dad, that's just a plant.++++@++++Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr.
Look, I brought you some nice pudding.++++@++++Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back.
Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. There's a reason two people come together and stay together. There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.++++@++++I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
Good luck, Dad.++++@++++All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.
I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!++++@++++Bye, Moe!
Homer, what happened to you?++++@++++Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can.
Oh, here, let me help you.++++@++++Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence.
Homer, that's not a good thing.++++@++++Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.
But, how do I know I can trust you?++++@++++Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again.
Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an "F".++++@++++Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.++++@++++Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.
So Marge, are you really happy, really?++++@++++Hey, Moe!
Homer, my hat goes off to you.++++@++++It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator.
Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing.++++@++++I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
Won't this overload the motor?++++@++++Marge, can you set the oven to cold?
CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? CanwehaveapoolDad? Canwe... etc.++++@++++I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
Over here we have "The Hick Tub," "The uh Insta-Rust," that's "The Lightning Magnet," that's "The Tinkler..."++++@++++Ooh, The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it.
I'm gonna miss the whole summer.++++@++++Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.
Well, it looks like it's just you and me, Barty Boy.++++@++++Ah...There's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool.
Dad... You have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean.++++@++++Chlorine, eh?
This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me.++++@++++Mmmm....
Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife.++++@++++But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt.
Oh, well I guess that explains everything.++++@++++Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
Um, I'm right here.++++@++++Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.
Hurry up and finish eating!++++@++++You're steerin' fine, boy... Hard to the right!
Oh!++++@++++Hard to the left!
Whoa!++++@++++Cat!... Deer!... Old Man!
Homer, that was downright decent of you.++++@++++We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener.
Dad, isn't this stealing?++++@++++Read your town charter, boy. "If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot." Since I don't see him around, start shoveling.
It hurts my teeth.++++@++++That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.
And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...++++@++++Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!
While you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday.++++@++++Woo hoo! A four day weekend!
Homer, Homer!++++@++++Huh, wha?
I want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid.++++@++++Oh am I, Am I really?
Hello.++++@++++All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?
Homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?++++@++++Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson.
Look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?++++@++++No!
Ah, very clever, Simpson. Luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price.++++@++++Bees are on the what, now?
Simpson, you diobolical... we're willing to pay you two thousand dollars for the swarm.++++@++++Deal!
Oh, wait a minute. The bees are leaving.++++@++++Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!
Wake up!++++@++++Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.++++@++++There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?
Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.++++@++++Hmmm.
No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.++++@++++Hm...
No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic.++++@++++Oh, okay.
Happy Valentine's.++++@++++Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off.
Okay, Homer.++++@++++Ooh, that was a close one, kids.
I guess we'll be goin' down together. I mean getting off togeth-- I mean...++++@++++That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.
Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want.++++@++++Oh, baby.
Yes, what did happen to her?++++@++++She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Well, kids, I tried. Maybe you're right.++++@++++Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right...
Yeah, you want a ride?++++@++++Sure.
You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with.++++@++++Who? Oh.
My prom date.++++@++++Marge, pour vous.
Why so glum?++++@++++I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go.
Ah, your first kiss.++++@++++But not the last.
Dad! Remember how you said that going to Itchy and Scratchy Land would be too damned expensive?++++@++++Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy.
Yeah. "Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."++++@++++TV Town! Hammock Land!
Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time.++++@++++Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
Well, there was our trip to the Amish Country...++++@++++Oh yes.
Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us.++++@++++Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed.
Agreed.++++@++++Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!
Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?++++@++++No.
What's the matter with you, Homer? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car.++++@++++The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge.
Haven't we stood in five different states long enough?++++@++++No.
We'd better find a motel and stop for the night.++++@++++We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.
Homer, no. You're going to get lost.++++@++++Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such.
Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?++++@++++What's that?
Do it, Dad.++++@++++Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see...
Bart!++++@++++Eyeball stew.
Tortureland, Explosion Land, Searing Gas Pain Land, Unnecessary Surgery Land...++++@++++Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals.++++@++++Parents Island?
Dad?++++@++++I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
I have nothing to say to you.++++@++++But Marge, I was a political prisoner.
How were you a political prisoner?++++@++++I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Oh for gosh sakes, what now?++++@++++Hey look, this one's coming on to me.
Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend.++++@++++Lisa, don't contradict your elders.
Oh my, it looks like we're doomed!++++@++++Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits.++++@++++What're you, the narrator?
Hey, mouse! Say cheese. Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.++++@++++Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.
As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank you for stopping the killer robots. And to show my appreciation, here are two free passes.++++@++++But there are five of us.
Here are two free passes.++++@++++That's better.
Yeah, switch the station. I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.++++@++++Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit "fruit-y" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me...
Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else?++++@++++When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station.
That sounds like Sideshow Bob!++++@++++Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box.
Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is.++++@++++Phew.
Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail.++++@++++Uh-huh.
When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her.++++@++++Oh, Sideshow Bob.
Ack! Help! I'm being attacked by uh things!++++@++++It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!
Homer, we've got to stop them.++++@++++I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!
Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics.++++@++++Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign.++++@++++Hey, Mr. Smithers!
This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials.++++@++++John Denver.
Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well.++++@++++I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!
So what'll it be, Homer?++++@++++Moe! Give me a beer!
No. Not unless you kill your family.++++@++++Why should I kill my family?
Uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts.++++@++++You don't look so happy.
This is less encouraging.++++@++++So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of "No TV and No Beer Make Homer..." something something.
Go crazy?++++@++++Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!
Homer, it's Moe. Ah, look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward.++++@++++Can't murder now. Eating.
C'mon.++++@++++Noooo!
Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded.++++@++++Must kill family. .
Dad, look!++++@++++Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover.
Homer, change channel!++++@++++Can't. Frozen.
ONE / SINGULAR SENSATION...++++@++++Urge to kill rising.
Dad!! Daaadd!! Homer!!++++@++++Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!
Okilly dokilly.++++@++++Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?
Just relax, let the hooks do their work.++++@++++What the hell are you smiling at?
It's Bliiiiisssss.++++@++++Nooooo!
Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?++++@++++Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?
Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you?++++@++++Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.
Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?++++@++++No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today.
Have you noticed any change in Bart?++++@++++New glasses?
No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.++++@++++Probably misses his old glasses.
I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.++++@++++Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
That's not what I meant.++++@++++It was, Marge. Admit it.
Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug.++++@++++Oh good, here comes the collection plate.
Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. Homer!++++@++++We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed.
He confessed!++++@++++Stop him! He's headed for the window!
I didn't take it.++++@++++Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
Homer, stop that. I believe him.++++@++++Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?
That's what he wore to church.++++@++++Ooo, how convenient.
If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money.++++@++++To the little girl's room!
Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me at the Springfield Laugh 'n Brew 'n Burgers 'n Fries this Saturday. The forecast calls for a seventy-five percent chance of hilarity.++++@++++I like those odds.
Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder.++++@++++Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?
Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates.++++@++++Done and done.
That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?++++@++++Ah, the mysteries of life.
Cheer up. So you're not good at sports. It's a very small part of life.++++@++++Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.
I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front, too?++++@++++I tried.
Oh yes, we won! We won! We won! Um, unfortunately, since I bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza.++++@++++Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well.
Please, Dad, I'll be fine.++++@++++I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?
I can't even watch. I don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.++++@++++We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference.
Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net I really think you helped your team.++++@++++Okay, little buddy, hop in!
That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love.++++@++++Okay, hon.
Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two episodes of Cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three.++++@++++Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know...
Hey Milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo! Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone!++++@++++Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you.
Mr. Honeybunny!++++@++++Quiet down, Bart!
Hm, I better go check that out. Now Homer, don't you eat this pie.++++@++++Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this.
I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.++++@++++Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump.++++@++++I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.
Stop it! Stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game.++++@++++Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best.
Hi Mom! Over here! Mom!++++@++++Hi kids!
Ew. Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash.++++@++++You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. .
How did you get tickets?++++@++++They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.
No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!++++@++++Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side.
Oh, well thank you Homer. But take one of the kids.++++@++++Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you.
Homer, are all these pockets necessary?++++@++++They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!++++@++++Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers.
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk... The front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar.++++@++++I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
As you can see, I have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. The candy, known as 77X42 -- Where the hell is the candy?++++@++++I don't know.
One, a humorous substitute for your own lips.++++@++++Mmm hmm. Keep going.
Ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.++++@++++Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
Will you two stop saying "gummy" so much.++++@++++Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!
Oooh... how'd they get there?++++@++++Now, this is going to take all my skill.
Halt! Halt!++++@++++Run, Marge! Save the booty!
I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.++++@++++Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.
I'm sorry?++++@++++Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once.
Just drop me off here.++++@++++Precious Venus...
There he is! There's the man that sexually harassed me!++++@++++For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...
Two four six eight / Homer's crime was very great! "Great" meaning "large or immense" / We used it in the pejorative sense!++++@++++Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a schoolgirl.
You grabbed me in the car!++++@++++Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?++++@++++Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.++++@++++That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.
And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?++++@++++Well, that's kind of a gray area.
We know you're innocent, Dad.++++@++++Thanks, kids.
Homer! Wake up! Wake up!++++@++++Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!
You people aren't allowed in here.++++@++++It's okay, they're with me.
Homer--++++@++++Uh-huh?
I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do.++++@++++You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!
We're aware of your problems and Mr. Simpson, we want to help.++++@++++Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it.
That was really great, Mr. Simpson, we got everything we need.++++@++++Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style.
Homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It's not gonna happen.++++@++++Not with that attitude.
Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.++++@++++It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me.
Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good.++++@++++Whaa?
And now, we return to Fox Night at the Movies. "Homer S.: Portrait of An Ass Grabber," starring Dennis Franz.++++@++++Ooh, "Portrait!" Sounds classy... doesn't it?
Now this technology is new to me, but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. Unless Proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will.++++@++++I don't have a friend in the world.
C'mon on let us through, you vultures.++++@++++Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.
It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you have.++++@++++Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
Ai yi yi! Es Homer Simpson. Me ha molestado. Ohh!++++@++++I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - "Evening at the Improv." They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.
See I think about weird stuff. Like what would happen if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E.T. wouldn't ya? And you know I think he'd sound a little something like this: I pity the fool who doesn't phone home.++++@++++Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now.
The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word "entertainment" -- Public Access Television.++++@++++But those shows all look so crummy.
Now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.++++@++++Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, "Father Goose." You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, "We'll see about that." So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I...
Ah, here we go.++++@++++Precious Venus...
Hmm. Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. I guess she was right.++++@++++You're both right.
Wow. V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.++++@++++And Ted Koppel is a robot.
Tomorrow on Rock Bottom. He's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. He's Rowdy Roddy Peeper.++++@++++Oh, that man is sick!
Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer.++++@++++But listen to the music. He's evil!
Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?++++@++++Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.
Is there something wrong, Homie?++++@++++No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise.
We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.++++@++++Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book?++++@++++Ooooookay.
A tasteful book.++++@++++Oh. All right.
Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery.++++@++++Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...
This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.++++@++++Oooh. "Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."
HomeIE, I can't quite...++++@++++Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice...++++@++++Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.
The uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh Caveman Room!++++@++++Oh, here we are. The "Utility Room."
This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room.++++@++++No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.
Welcome home, Son. I broke two lamps and lost all your mail. What's wrong with your wife?++++@++++Never mind. You wouldn't understand.
Flu?++++@++++No.
Protein deficiency?++++@++++No.
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis?++++@++++No.
Oh, Homey, what's--++++@++++Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.
Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one! That tonic really works! You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together.++++@++++You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?
You could make a lot of money.++++@++++Yeah... Where are my pants?
Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid...++++@++++Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
Now, sir, you have never seen me before. Is that correct?++++@++++That is correct.
You're the worst shill I ever seen! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business!++++@++++They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
Hey, wait a minute. That's Amos Pierson's Moose Farm. Make a right, here.++++@++++Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?
Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead.++++@++++Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.
That's 'cause you're a screw-up.++++@++++You're the screw-up!
Why you little...!++++@++++All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
I'm sorry I said that.++++@++++Out.
Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?++++@++++Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!
You didn't want to have Bart.++++@++++I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child.
You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.++++@++++But when I do it, it's cute.
Aw, nuts.++++@++++Dad!
Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike.++++@++++You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president.
No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me.++++@++++Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.++++@++++B-But I'm using my whole ass.
Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.++++@++++Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
No, I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.++++@++++You know what?
It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.++++@++++So are you gonna say something nice now?
Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man.++++@++++Aw, Dad.
Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?++++@++++I'm with you, Dad.
Oh I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar.++++@++++This is gonna to be great.
Yeah!++++@++++Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me.
And I'm pulling your favorite song out of the juke box.++++@++++It's Raining Men?
Oww. Ohh...++++@++++Jokes on them. I'm still alive.
Cheer up, Homer.++++@++++Can't.
What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. Huh?++++@++++I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?++++@++++Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?
Right here, Dad.++++@++++Thank you!
Good evening, sir. Would you please leave without a fuss right now?++++@++++Okay.
I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth yet.++++@++++Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies.
Homer? Who is Homer? My name is Guy Incognito.++++@++++Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!
Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.++++@++++Uh, but I am a pilot.
Where's your uniform?++++@++++I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
You.++++@++++But I -
Hey, you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?++++@++++Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here.
Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your co-pilot.++++@++++Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.
If word gets out about this, Kwazy Klown Airlines will be a laughing stock. In exchange for your silence, I'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United States. Excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The freak states.++++@++++Woo hoo!
I don't know, Homer. We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season.++++@++++But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state.
I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.++++@++++Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?
See, Dad. I told you Mom would have problems.++++@++++Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?
Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors.++++@++++Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?
Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.++++@++++Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.
Well, everybody's got a fear of something.++++@++++Not everybody.
Sock puppets.++++@++++Where? Where?
Sure as sugar.++++@++++Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again.
No, no honey, it's all right. Really. I'm fine. I'm all right. Mother always said "don't complain. Be good. Behave, behave. Be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."++++@++++You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.
Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive.++++@++++And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
Thank you for calling "Radio Psychic." Do you have a song request?++++@++++It's Raining Men!
Dad, Mom's getting worse. You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.++++@++++She's fine.
Dad, I like picking beans with grandma.++++@++++Well keep it up, then.
Okay, I will.++++@++++Good, you do that.
Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.++++@++++Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.
If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale. I can go as low as thirty dollars an hour.++++@++++Keep sliding.
Thirty dollars will be fine.++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?
But it's a few seconds before 12:00.++++@++++You see?! You see?! "I" just left "my" first session and "I" haven't opened "my" mouth yet.
Ready for breakfast, Doctor Smith?++++@++++Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have.
Warning. Warning. Doctor Smith refuses to do his astro chores.++++@++++Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!
You know, Marge. We've really just begun to scratch the surface. There's still the far more serious problem of your husband.++++@++++That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.
Hm, emergency call. Gotta go.++++@++++What should we do until you get back?
Put a pan down there.++++@++++Aw, it didn't work.
Yeah, we got uh, things to do.++++@++++Like what?
It's a secret.++++@++++Shut up.
A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?++++@++++I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go.
Oh, Homer. Don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?++++@++++Well, something did.
I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.++++@++++Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl.
Oh well. That was a real nice secret organization we had once.++++@++++Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?
There are only two ways to gain membership. Be the son of a Stonecutter...++++@++++Next.
Forget it, Homer. While it has been established that eggs contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream.++++@++++So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?
You got it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that.++++@++++You'd better run, egg!
Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.++++@++++Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.++++@++++It is. It's been happening to me all my life.
I'm a member.++++@++++What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
You don't know what they do there, do you?++++@++++Not as such, no.
Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?++++@++++Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge.
I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist... I'm the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason... Ah, here it is. The Stonecutters.++++@++++This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
Okay, okay, Homer. You're in. Just don't point that thing at me!++++@++++Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?
As soon as Number One gets here.++++@++++Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? "Hello, my name is Number One." And so forth.
We call each other by number, not by name. Carl is number 14, I'm number 12. Burnsie is number 29.++++@++++You outrank Mr. Burns here?
Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder.++++@++++Is he the leader?
Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold that someday a Chosen One will...++++@++++Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story.
Happy landings.++++@++++I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
And this we call "The Unblinking Eye."++++@++++Hey, have you ever noticed that the "Crossing the Desert" is a lot like "The Unblinking Eye" and it's exactly like "The Wreck of the Hesperus"?
And now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.++++@++++And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
Well to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks.++++@++++Oh really?
Yes, yes.++++@++++But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
Same old space, huh, Dad?++++@++++Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door.
Well... no. We've got the same chair.++++@++++You're jealous.
Your membership pack.++++@++++What's this?
You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets. And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet while they're working on you.++++@++++Everything lasts forever.
I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.++++@++++That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
We just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-life commoner.++++@++++You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
Homer, a man who called himself "You Know Who" just invited you to a secret "wink wink" at the "you know what." You certainly are popular now that you're a Stonecutter.++++@++++Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined.
WHO ROBS CAVE FISH OF THEIR SIGHT? /++++@++++WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /
Thank you. Tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th Anniversary. And in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs.++++@++++Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren.
/ This is just appalling and outrageous.++++@++++What? Did I miss something?
/ That's it!++++@++++Oh. Sorry.
The mark!++++@++++Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.
You are the Chosen One, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. Now to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation! Remove the stone of shame!++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting.++++@++++So?
Beware the Ides of March.++++@++++No.
Don't you see? Getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.++++@++++Remove the girl.
Another strike for the Chosen One! Hurrah!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Absolutely.++++@++++Woo hoo!
No, no, Homer. You have a... royal... sampler.++++@++++Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo.
"Good one, Chosen One." Etc.++++@++++You know, I think you guys are lettin' me win.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.++++@++++From now on, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right?
Yay!++++@++++Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading.
You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.++++@++++What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated.
Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.++++@++++Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War .
Dad, that doesn't help people.++++@++++Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
Aw, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club.++++@++++Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate.
Silence! I now call to order the first meeting of the Ancient Mystic Society of NoHomers.++++@++++Hey, fellas. Can I join?
Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites.++++@++++Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club.
I meant our wedding rings.++++@++++You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.
Incorrect. Look. A canal.++++@++++Go Knightboat, go!
Or a fjord.++++@++++Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.
Okay, TV off. It's family time.++++@++++But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat.
Why don't we all look at the photo album?++++@++++So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat.
Aw.++++@++++Thanks honey. Bank shot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures.++++@++++Moom.
Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?++++@++++Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story.
Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy.++++@++++Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
Attention American workers. Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.++++@++++Not on my shift.
Homer! Tell the story right.++++@++++Okay.
Your paychecks, gentlemen.++++@++++Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt.
Good aim, Dad.++++@++++Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job.
But Homer, how're you gonna make a living?++++@++++Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
Hey, what did we do?++++@++++Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya.
Is that so?++++@++++Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!
He's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.++++@++++That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
Sure.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants.++++@++++Why?
I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.
Me too. Let's go home.++++@++++I love you, Marge.
I love you too, Homie.++++@++++Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
Did you have to be so graphic?++++@++++It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school.
So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?++++@++++Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed.
Homer, did you polish your head in the "Shine-O Ball-O?"++++@++++No.
Okay then.++++@++++...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down.
Hey, great job, Homer. / Thanks a lot./ You're the best.++++@++++I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
Homie, I--++++@++++Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.
Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer.++++@++++Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.
Oh Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir.++++@++++It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money.
Hey Homer, way to get Marge pregnant. Heh, heh, heh.++++@++++This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley.
Oh really.++++@++++Man. It's windy as hell out there.
By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer.++++@++++New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?++++@++++Oh just that one time.
Actually, when I was about to have Bart...++++@++++You're pregnant?!
And then when I told him about Lisa...++++@++++You're pregnant again?!
Ooh, I don't have that.++++@++++You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
Homer! Let your father tell the story.++++@++++Yeah.
Okay, but I know funny.++++@++++Anyhoo...
Homer, you had a head.++++@++++Check.
You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?++++@++++Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say...
When he's done in there, I gotta go.++++@++++How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing.++++@++++This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey.
See ya 'round, Mr. Homer.++++@++++Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day.
Yes, are you a new applicant?++++@++++Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.
So, come crawling back, eh?++++@++++Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
Well, actually -++++@++++I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
My contractions started an hour ago.++++@++++It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge.
Argh -- you're truly the catch of the day!++++@++++It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth.
One more push should do it.++++@++++Marvelous.
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby.++++@++++Okay.
Homie, I think someone is saying hello.++++@++++Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.
Uh, that's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.++++@++++A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!
So, you loved her right from the start.++++@++++Absolutely.
Then why no pictures?++++@++++Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up.
NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!++++@++++...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.++++@++++Yeah, except I forgot to go to work.
Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of...++++@++++Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?
No, Dad, I don't think...++++@++++There's that word again.
Homer, what if this doesn't work?++++@++++Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
Dad, the plan!++++@++++I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
Daaad, they're firing the rocket!++++@++++All right!
We're doomed!++++@++++It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
Turn it off.++++@++++Just a second.
Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.++++@++++Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.
We have a bomb shelter?++++@++++Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?++++@++++Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families.++++@++++No deal. Out.
One more hour.++++@++++An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
All right!++++@++++I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer.++++@++++Uh, yeah. I can do that.
Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy...++++@++++Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders.
Say Moe, was it a duck?++++@++++No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there.
Yeah, dad was right.++++@++++I know kids, I'm scared too.
So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise.++++@++++I am holding still. I am squirming.
Finders keepers.++++@++++"This year give her English Muffins." Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.
Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire.++++@++++Clowns are funny.
I think I'll have some wine.++++@++++Marge.
Yes, Homie?++++@++++That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
I don't think any of us expected him to say that.++++@++++Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!++++@++++You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.
New Hampshire.++++@++++Homer.
Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy!++++@++++Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.
Okay, memorize these funny place names. Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, Seattle...++++@++++Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
And now everybody's favorite, the "spin cycle fantastique" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool.++++@++++Steady, steady...
Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong.++++@++++Kill wealthy dowager.
This is the happiest day of my life. A-YAH-ha.++++@++++Got it! No shock for me .
It's the Krusty Burglar!++++@++++Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!
I'm a boy.++++@++++That's the spirit. Never give up.
Hey, nice threads.++++@++++I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards.
Boy, you're really running yourself ragged.++++@++++Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.
Well my time's almost up here, so uh, I'd just like to say I know Woody Allen.++++@++++And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old "Starsky and Hutches."
Let's walk and talk. I ah, I have some wonderful stories about other famous people that include me in some way.++++@++++Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo.
Hey! Me too! We can go together.++++@++++Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick.
Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I was having dinner with Groucho, and...++++@++++Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.
Well, well, well "Velocity Boy," I am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... Hey! Krusty!++++@++++I'm not Krusty.
Oh, to think I was going to give you a ticket! Krusty the Klown!++++@++++I am not Krusty.
Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty.++++@++++Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development.
I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest.++++@++++Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?
Right, Boss.++++@++++I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!
Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty... but I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only thirty-eight thousand.++++@++++Hey, what are these holes?
These are speed holes. They make the car go faster.++++@++++Oh yeah. Speed holes.
Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?++++@++++Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.
Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.++++@++++What keeps doin' that?
The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?++++@++++Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.
The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?++++@++++Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi.
I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great-a fan. Don Vittorio Dimaggio.++++@++++Krusty the clown.
I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and I will let you live.++++@++++But, I've never been able to do the...
Go! Go!++++@++++Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.++++@++++Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
I am confused.++++@++++Heh-heh, good one, Krusty.
Without the loop, it is nothing.++++@++++Ta-Da!
Are we in any dange--++++@++++Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?
Hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... I'm being indicted for fraud in Australia.++++@++++Psh, that's no reason to block the TV.
Yes'm.++++@++++There it is. "Aust-rali-a." I'll be damned...
And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further.++++@++++Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?
Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison Bart for five years.++++@++++That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man.
You're sure now, the prison train is sailing... Okay, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. There is one other option. They'll drop the charges if... Bart makes a public apology in Australia.++++@++++All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?
No. To combat homesickness, we've installed a device that makes them swirl the correct, American way.++++@++++SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.
Actually, sir, the embassy is considered American soil, sir.++++@++++Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!
Homer, that's enough.++++@++++--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!
All right, all right, you win. I see you've played knife-y spoony before.++++@++++Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about.
Something wrong, yank?++++@++++No. It's pretty big, I guess.
Well, you're free to go, Bart. Right after your additional punishment.++++@++++Punishment?!
Well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? Let the booting begin!++++@++++Booting?
Yuh-oh.++++@++++What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
Mr. Simpson, shhsh! Disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. It's one of their proudest traditions.++++@++++You sold us out, Conover!
Ewww. It's not like in cartoons.++++@++++Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!
Liiiiisa!++++@++++Maaarge!
Thank you, Bart. I promise I won't make fun of you later for this.++++@++++Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!
Yeah, Homer. What's your secret investment?++++@++++Take a guess.
Uh, pumpkins?++++@++++Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in.
Homer, you knucklebeak, I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween. Before!++++@++++All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one.
Hello, Homer.++++@++++Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick.
Yeah, Homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once.++++@++++All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man.++++@++++Wrong!
I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that. He may not be a big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide for the family.++++@++++Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow.
Every person in America now owns one of these, and in many cases three or four.++++@++++Uh, could I just get a look at that?
Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented... the product in question.++++@++++But uh, could I just...
Now don't worry. You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.++++@++++Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!
Homer, wake up. There's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime.++++@++++No, my invention! All my money problems could've...
Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?++++@++++Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not.
Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance.++++@++++Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?
I understand that, Mr. Simpson. But according to our computer, your credit history is not good. It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner.++++@++++That was in the third grade.
Yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. I'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house.++++@++++Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight.
Well we'll look for the house with no numbers.++++@++++Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
Well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.++++@++++All right, you'll get your money.
You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad.++++@++++Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.
Now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!++++@++++Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
It means...++++@++++It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn.++++@++++All right, you had your fun. Now get lost.
Oh, our fun hasn't begun yet.++++@++++Hunh?
You are?++++@++++No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.
Let's go, Homer. On the way home, we're all stopping at Moe's for a Zima.++++@++++Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again.
Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?++++@++++Request permission to slink by.
Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes.++++@++++But you're already smoking cig...
C'mon, Homer. You can't spell obsequious without "IOU."++++@++++I'll have to trust you on that.
Well, Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her.++++@++++No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
Ah-ah-ah-ah! Just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.++++@++++But... Yes, ma'am.
What's going on in here?++++@++++Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge.
What's that paper?++++@++++What paper?
Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?++++@++++I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.
He blew all your savings on jack-o-lanterns.++++@++++You told!
Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?++++@++++I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight.
Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table.++++@++++Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
But I like to make you breakfast.++++@++++In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar.
Hey Dad, whatcha doing?++++@++++What was that -- national anthem?
Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.++++@++++Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.
Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.++++@++++That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.
I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.++++@++++No. Well anyway, turn it off.
Uhm, thanks.++++@++++Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face.
Homer, it's not that easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I...++++@++++Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?
Evening Simpson... You got a short in your taillight. It started blinkin' when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license.++++@++++Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!
"Tested," Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time.++++@++++Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm.
Well, well, well. Look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's license.++++@++++Look, all I ask is that you be fair.
Failed to check blind spot, minus two points.++++@++++You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?
Ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point.++++@++++Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you.
Grazed a cone, minus five points.++++@++++Being a jerk, minus a million points.
So Homer, how'd you do?++++@++++Well, I...
uh... she uh...++++@++++I'll never forgive myself for this.
Wait a minute, those are yours, sir?++++@++++Yes. I am in flavor country.
Both of them?++++@++++It's a big country.
Homer, I'm -- I'm speechless. You just saved our hides.++++@++++Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides.
That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.++++@++++I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you.
If there's anything we can do to make it up...++++@++++Call off the debt?
Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test.++++@++++Call off the debt?
Uh... well...++++@++++Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!
This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.++++@++++But what can I do? I'm just... one man.
Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as "Homer in the Shower," and "Homer on the Toilet." And now, I give you... "The Eternal Struggle."++++@++++Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled.
I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance...++++@++++My ears are burning.
Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad.++++@++++No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip.
"You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."++++@++++Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours.++++@++++Oh, you're right.
Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane. And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil.++++@++++It was a gummy bear.
Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.++++@++++Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic.
Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.++++@++++But, I'm still hungry.
How droll.++++@++++Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!
Muh... muh... muh...++++@++++Whatcha doing, Marge?
Making out the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby -- Krusty -- Jay --++++@++++Marge, do you respect my intelligence?
No reason.++++@++++Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?
You don't have to do this.++++@++++Yeah, well you think I'm stupid.
I don't think you're stupid.++++@++++Prove it.
Next.++++@++++Exactly. Heh, heh.
Oh boy, this is gonna get worse before it gets better.++++@++++Pull my finger.
Hans Moleman Productions presents "Man Getting Hit By Football."++++@++++This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!
This isn't "America's Funniest Home Videos."++++@++++But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.
I think we have a winner.++++@++++What'd I miss?
Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you.++++@++++Football in the groin. Football in the groin.
Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads.++++@++++Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute.
How did you know my name?++++@++++I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that?++++@++++Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me.
Well, Homer.++++@++++Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.
Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.++++@++++Wow. I'll never drink another beer.
Beer here!++++@++++I'll take ten.
Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury.++++@++++Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket.
Your name tag.++++@++++Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts.
Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.++++@++++Can I have some?
Mine ears are open only to the pleas of those who speak ye old English.++++@++++Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon.
Whatever.++++@++++I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.
...except for the international market it's my...++++@++++Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!
Hey, hey there with the personal calls Simpson.++++@++++Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!
Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.++++@++++Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock.
Oh Lisa!++++@++++Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?
Now throw compost on it!++++@++++Whew! Uh, enjoy.
Oh, still warm.++++@++++You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.
Homer! Bart! Maggie! Company eating rules.++++@++++Oh, right.
Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school.++++@++++So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger.
Yes, we have that one in England too, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++I said, pull my finger.
Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.++++@++++Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.
Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.++++@++++Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
That's true.++++@++++Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.
You know, Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice.++++@++++Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.
Well, here goes nothing. Mom, Dad, meet Homer Simpson.++++@++++Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya.
Thanks.++++@++++Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
Dad, you're babbling.++++@++++See? You're still helping me.
Hey, Dad. Did you forget to give those cufflinks to Hugh?++++@++++Aw, no...
Well?++++@++++I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
Wow. What else did you do, Dad?++++@++++I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!
Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!++++@++++Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?++++@++++Did they?!
My strobe light!++++@++++My "Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!
Yes, the dog...++++@++++Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!
Please?++++@++++Well, problem solved.
Homer, hold on to the wheel!++++@++++You got it.
Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!++++@++++Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know.
And they're off! She's The Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!++++@++++You're lucky you got looks, Marge.
As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed by Always Comes In Second and I'm Number Three...++++@++++Yes! Come on, you little horse!
Aww...++++@++++Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex.
Look, it's twins!++++@++++Now it's two sets of twins.
Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?++++@++++Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family.
Look at Branford II! Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc.++++@++++Get that cat out of the way!
Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?++++@++++Do you have a better idea?
Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today!++++@++++How do you explain the culottes, boy?
Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?++++@++++Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
Nooooooo!++++@++++Mainly your mother.
All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight.++++@++++Splendid. Who's coming?
...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets...++++@++++Who wouldn't?
She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust.++++@++++Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?
My, he certainly took that well.++++@++++A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies.
You don't have the guts to take us all on.++++@++++Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds.
Check mate.++++@++++Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.
But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.++++@++++Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.
Relax? I can't relax. Nor can I yield, relent, or... Only two synonyms? Oh my God! I'm losing my perspicacity!++++@++++Well, it's always in the last place you look.
I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat.++++@++++I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.++++@++++Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there.
There's no way I'll get into an Ivy League school now. At this rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.++++@++++Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady.
Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions.++++@++++Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!
No thanks to you, Homer.++++@++++Why you little...
Um, the guy who chopped up George Washington?++++@++++Really? Wow.
Mom, I think he's serious.++++@++++Kids are so naÃ¯ve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says "Do Not Feed The Bears," man, you'd better not feed the bears.
Don't worry, son, you'll be fine. This boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst, which will make it easier to find once I get in there .++++@++++Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog.
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Now Homer, please. The boy has just had a very serious operation.++++@++++Oh, right.
Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.++++@++++Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy.
Thank you. Oh Dad, why did he have to die?++++@++++Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over.
Oh, Dad!++++@++++I blew it again.
Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you. But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them.++++@++++Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.
You didn't know him! Nobody knew him! But he was a great man! And I won't rest until all of Springfield knows the name of Bleeding Gums Murphy!++++@++++And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
Hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him.++++@++++Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.++++@++++OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo
Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?++++@++++They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers.++++@++++Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.
Devilishishly satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that?++++@++++We're outta here!
Three Card Monte.++++@++++Woo hoo! Easy money!
Homie, these games are fixed.++++@++++Then how come that guy's winning?
He's getting away!! C'mon! C'mon!++++@++++No Marge!!
Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating.++++@++++Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman.
Oh for crying out loud...++++@++++Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here.
I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?++++@++++Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
You got it, little buddy.++++@++++Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.
Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house.++++@++++Aw, thanks, honey.
Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.++++@++++Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me.
Homer, give me my pepper spray.++++@++++Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border.
Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.++++@++++Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun.
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!++++@++++. Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though.
Hey, great news, guys. I picked up a nudie deck for our game.++++@++++"The Girls of the Internet." Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day.
Homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may.++++@++++Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.
C'mon, put that away. Those radar guns give you cancer.++++@++++All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --
We'll be goin'... / We'll just be goin'... / We don't want no trouble, officer...++++@++++Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.
I didn't mean to.++++@++++Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.
I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.++++@++++You're cooking what for dinner?
Homer, I'm on duty.++++@++++That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too.
You have to move your car.++++@++++I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now.++++@++++I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket.++++@++++C'mon, we're family.
You're breaking the law.++++@++++I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!
Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.++++@++++What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc.
You have the right to remain silent...++++@++++I choose to waive that right.
All right, Simpson, you're free to go.++++@++++Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.++++@++++I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house Ã  la "I Love Lucy" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side.
Yeah, yeah, Barney's right. / Yeah. / Let's get some more beer. / Hey what about some beer? / Yeah, Barney's right!++++@++++All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage.
I'll, I'll-I'll get it, Homer.++++@++++Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
"Garage?" Hey fellas - "the garage". Ooo la de da, Mr. Frenchman.++++@++++Well, what do you call it?
And what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.++++@++++Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.
Not so fast.++++@++++Okay.
Maybe you should just stop entirely.++++@++++Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, "me too."
No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!++++@++++Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this.
Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.++++@++++Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you.
So long, gotta catch the 501.++++@++++He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!
That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago.++++@++++Marge, how did you know...
That the pants would rip?...++++@++++No, what I was wondering is...
That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence.++++@++++Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.
Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?++++@++++What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Death to Shelbyville!++++@++++Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!
We just got word there's Springfield kids in town!++++@++++Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech...
Isn't there anything we can do?++++@++++Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!
Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the...++++@++++Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!
Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out.++++@++++Found 'em!
But they stole our lemon tree!++++@++++I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!
Package for parcel processing. Pronto.++++@++++That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Bust in here and take it? You must be stupider than you look.++++@++++Stupider like a fox!
There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there.++++@++++Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down.
I'll get the gate.++++@++++That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.
It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!++++@++++Sorry.
We made it!++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Precisely.++++@++++Here's your package, Mr. Burns!
My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?++++@++++--son!
Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?++++@++++I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?
I have an idea.++++@++++What? What's your idea?
When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him.++++@++++That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?
Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?++++@++++Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card.
"Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie." Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.++++@++++Kids, would you step outside for a second?
Who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / Puddinghead? / Mooncalf? / Limpnoodle? / Goldbricker? Drizzlepuss? / Cueball? / Fumblefist? / Galoot?++++@++++Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!
Look out!++++@++++What?
Who the devil are you?!++++@++++Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of...++++@++++Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!
He robbed the school of Tito!++++@++++He can't remember my name!
Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.++++@++++Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?
Could not!++++@++++Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.
We don't have an outhouse.++++@++++My tool shed! Oh Dad!
Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?++++@++++Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.++++@++++Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name...
Who wants chocolate ice cream?++++@++++Me! Me! Me, me!
Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.++++@++++I swear, I've never seen that gun before.
Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?++++@++++Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit.
Homer Simpson?++++@++++So you finally learned my name, eh?
Homer Simpson.++++@++++I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
Ho-mer Simp... son. Ho... mersimp... son.++++@++++Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?++++@++++Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
Bart, why are you talking like that?++++@++++Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?
You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God.++++@++++Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here.
We'll run that cable through here.++++@++++Careful now.
Heh, yes I did.++++@++++Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!
Eh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.++++@++++You guys work on the movie?
You saying we're not working?++++@++++Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?
Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself.++++@++++Marge, there's a spider near my car keys.
Shoo! Get outta here!++++@++++Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear.
"Good for a three hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa." Mineral bath, facial, massage... How did you afford these?++++@++++Oh, never you mind...
...gently massages your buttocks. Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the--++++@++++No we shan't. Yoink!
Homie, this is so sweet. But I can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess...++++@++++Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.
What about Maggie?++++@++++I got my dad to look after her.
Don't do that!++++@++++C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.
This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea.++++@++++Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel.
Those parents better have a good excuse.++++@++++I love gettin' away from this dump.
Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...++++@++++We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.++++@++++Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.++++@++++Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant.
No, I don't care for children.++++@++++Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!
And Margaret?++++@++++Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.
It's Maggie!++++@++++Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie.
I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called Family Skills. It teaches parents to listen to their...++++@++++Communication. Gotcha.
But it's important to...++++@++++Listen. Yes, I know.
But there's more to it than...++++@++++I have listening skills!
Mr. Simpson, would you please --++++@++++Shut up, Judge!
This is so humiliating.++++@++++Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.
It's so quiet here without the kids.++++@++++What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
I miss the way Bart would say something and then say "dude."++++@++++I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
You mean Maggie?++++@++++That's it.
There's Bart's ring!++++@++++Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that.
Paw, I cut myself on the screen door again.++++@++++Why you cotton pickin' --
I love you, Paw!++++@++++I love you, Cletus!
He's going to baptize our children?++++@++++Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!
Where we going? Where we going?++++@++++Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!
Do you reject Satan, and all his empty promises?++++@++++Noooooooo!
Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me. How do you feel?++++@++++Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
Wait, Homer. What did you just say?++++@++++I said shut your ugly face, Flanders.
Oh, fair enough.++++@++++Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.
So, what was it like at the Flanders' house?++++@++++Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!
There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though.++++@++++Old painty-can Ned!
Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?++++@++++I'm not ashamed.
So come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking.++++@++++How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.++++@++++I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.++++@++++Forty seconds? But I want it now.
Nothing.++++@++++Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?
COME TO UNCLE MOE'S FOR FAMILY FUN / IT'S GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.++++@++++Mmm. Sounds good.
Hiya, folks! Welcome to Uncle Moe's! Aw, look at all the cute little minors.++++@++++Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!
Right this way, Homer.++++@++++And he knows my name.
I can't take this anymore. I want my soul and I want it now!++++@++++Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!
Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.++++@++++Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?
Are we there yet?++++@++++No.
Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.++++@++++That's the plan.
What a load of crappy-crap-crap.++++@++++Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.
That's it, Honey. Get into the spirit.++++@++++It was good, but not great.
AWWWW.++++@++++Out of the way, you.
Hidilly ho, neighboreeno!++++@++++Shut up.
Can I come?++++@++++Sure.
Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.++++@++++You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever.
I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb!++++@++++Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb.
No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!++++@++++Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?
NO!++++@++++Pork chops?
Dad... those all come from the same animal.++++@++++Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal.
Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that.++++@++++Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's.
What's that extra b for?++++@++++That's a typo.
Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?++++@++++But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, "Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad.
Hey, Homer. Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.++++@++++Wow, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg.
Ahh. Diagnosis: delicious.++++@++++I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection.
Hey Homer, wing me another one of them burgers, would ya? I can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore.++++@++++One whopper for the copper.
Can I have a burger, dad?++++@++++Here ya go!
Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast.++++@++++Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
It's gone.++++@++++I know.
Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back.++++@++++Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!
I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room.++++@++++That's it! Go to your room!
You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?++++@++++Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.
Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.++++@++++Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.
Homer, you're not not talking to me. And secondly, I heard what you said.++++@++++Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.
Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to.++++@++++Bart, go to your room!
Why don't you just eat him, Dad.++++@++++I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all.
That's it. I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. I am out of here.++++@++++That's it. Go to your room.
Hi, Dad. Looking for me?++++@++++I dunno. Were you looking for me?
While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.++++@++++Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
I still stand by my beliefs, but I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.++++@++++I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.
Sorry, sir. No refunds.++++@++++I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm gonna get a colossal donut.
Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok have just reported an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen Belt. Scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken.++++@++++Eggheads. What do they know?
Homer! Where did you get that?++++@++++Get what?
That giant donut.++++@++++Well... I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that.
Help me! Help me, Lord!++++@++++I told you: Flanders has it. Or Moe! Go kill Moe.
Homer! Just give him the donut. Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.++++@++++Well... okay. If it'll end horror.
Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over there.++++@++++Mmmm.... sprinkles.
Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town. Lock your doors. Bar your windows. Because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family.++++@++++We'll be right back.
It all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. We were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.++++@++++Lousy Smarch weather.
Homer? Get ready. Patty and Selma will be here any minute.++++@++++Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet.
Sorry, dad. This is our spot.++++@++++Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot.
Nuh-uh, 'cause we called it.++++@++++Did not.
Well, we're calling it now.++++@++++You are?
'Fraid so.++++@++++They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
Do you see a light, Homer?++++@++++That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
You're gonna help us clean and organize 'em. And pry out all the dead hermit crabs. Get a screwdriver.++++@++++I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
Hey! You can just suck 'em out!++++@++++Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Homer? Where are you?++++@++++I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.++++@++++Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before.
Ah, the shower!++++@++++Hey!
We better call Ned. He has a ladder.++++@++++What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...
Hunh. It's like he just disappeared into fat air.++++@++++Hey, shut up!
Move into the light, my son.++++@++++Ow!
Homer, this is your physician, Dr. Julius Hibbert. Can you tell us what it's like in there?++++@++++Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie "Tron"?
This forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube" or a "Frinkahedron", in honor of its discoverer .++++@++++Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?
Take that, you lousy dimension!++++@++++Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy.
No, Pops, it's too risky. For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large...++++@++++Help! I don't have much time!
Cool, man!++++@++++I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...
Oh, I can't get any closer! You'll have to jump!++++@++++Piece of cake, son!
Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic.++++@++++Craaaaaaaaaap!
Hmm... That one!++++@++++Someone's in here.
Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth.++++@++++Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait.
Raise your right hock. Aerate! Raise your left hock. Aerate! I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts!++++@++++TWO!
Actually, Homer, that's just one. See, each push-up includes both an "up" part and a "down" part.++++@++++Arrgh!
Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. Pfft. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.++++@++++Stupidity, eh?
Yes?++++@++++Hello.
May I help you?++++@++++Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?
You can do it, old boy!++++@++++Yes I can.
If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?++++@++++Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!
I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.++++@++++I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body.
Have you told mom about this?++++@++++No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us.
Da-ad!++++@++++Yes, sweetheart?
Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.++++@++++Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy.
My God, that's monstrous... I've never heard of anything so neglige-- I'll have no part of it.++++@++++Can you recommend a doctor who will?
Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology.++++@++++Of course.
You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic.++++@++++What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?
Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work.++++@++++I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack.++++@++++Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...
Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?++++@++++Any time I want.
Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?++++@++++I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability.
Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?++++@++++So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow.
Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--++++@++++Beautiful. G'night.
Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.++++@++++I need a miracle.
Dad? It says "Non-Toxic."++++@++++Well, that's a plus.
Ah, Dad? Towel rack...?++++@++++Oh my.
... Yes, Simpson.++++@++++Thank you for your pity.
Work, huh? Let me guess: Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist? Something with computers.++++@++++Well, I use a computer!
What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes...++++@++++I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.
Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute! Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! Due to a fire at the Army Testing Lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the Expressway! Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable!++++@++++I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
I like school.++++@++++Well, why don't you live in it then?
Homer, we need to have a serious talk.++++@++++You dragged me all the way from work for that?
Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?++++@++++I...
Con: You're setting a bad example for the children.++++@++++Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work.
Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here.++++@++++Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?
Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically.++++@++++Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here.
Good. Good for you.++++@++++Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y.
I'm going out. I run errands during the day.++++@++++Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
Dad, what are you doing down there?++++@++++Washing my fat guy hat, honey.
Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings.++++@++++Hey, what are you kids looking at?
Hey, look. He's trying to get up to yell at us.++++@++++Don't make me close the shade!
Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside.++++@++++Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.
Shouldn't you be working?++++@++++I got someone to cover for me.
I'm terribly sorry, sir. But I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs.++++@++++What are you talking about?
Well, what I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats.++++@++++I could sit in the aisle.
Hey, Fatty! I got a movie for ya -- "A Fridge Too Far."++++@++++Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see "Honk If You're Horny" in peace.
Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac.++++@++++Oh, that's raspberry.
Who cares? It's Homer's problem.++++@++++Wait, I know! "Vent Gas."
Ten hi-ya-ya! And nine hi-ya-ya..!++++@++++Get away, dammit! Run for your lives!
What can I get for thirty cents?++++@++++Let go! I gotta get to the tank!
... One hi-ya-ya!++++@++++Wait a minute! There's probably a --
We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.++++@++++Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there. But... For a while I feared for my life.
Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.++++@++++Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?
Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this?++++@++++Hey everybody! Up here!
Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!++++@++++Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --
That dummy worked like a charm, Dad.++++@++++Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it.
Okay, Mr. Simpson, I'll just make the change here ...and you're all set.++++@++++I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it.
You sure do.++++@++++"Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..." Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is "Margaret" Simpson?
This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens or "Melrose Place."++++@++++"Youngest daughter..." Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid.
You awful, awful man. Get out of my son's grave.++++@++++I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?
Oh, Homer, you grew up so handsome.++++@++++Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
Oh, my poor baby. You must have been so upset... but I suppose Abe has his reasons.++++@++++Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?
Oh, it's a very complicated story. Let's just enjoy this moment.++++@++++Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment.
Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars.++++@++++I'll Kwaanza you!
Homer, don't be so hard on little... What is his name?++++@++++This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
Me, too!++++@++++Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!
These are the calling cards of a con artist.++++@++++Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
She's nice.++++@++++But?
I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.++++@++++First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason.
Which was?++++@++++I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
Oh, Homie. C'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son.++++@++++Then why did she leave me?
Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook. And I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.++++@++++Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?
But I did. I sent you a care package every week.++++@++++Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp.
No. Oh, wait. This.++++@++++Hey!
HOW MANY ROADS MUST A MAN WALK DOWN / BEFORE YOU CAN CALL HIM A MAN?++++@++++Seven!
No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question.++++@++++Rhetorical, eh? Eight.
Dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means?++++@++++Do I know what "rhetorical" means?!
Gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield?++++@++++You could live with Grampa again.
You know, Lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while.++++@++++Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?
We made it, Homer!++++@++++It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you, and why did you tip us off?
well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma that was keeping me out of the Academy.++++@++++Thanks.
Yeah, just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police to become Chief Clancy Wig --++++@++++Yak yak yak yak yak.
Well, there's my ride. The underground awaits.++++@++++At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.
Oh, hurry up, man. This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left.++++@++++Don't forget me.
Oh, just think, Lis, that's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel.++++@++++That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?
And he tried to murder me.++++@++++Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?
Da-ad! Why aren't you looking?++++@++++Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?
Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus, I submit to you: we abolish television. Permanently.++++@++++Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!
I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?++++@++++I'm sure they're fine, honey.
Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!++++@++++Well, I wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll.
Bogie's airspeed not sufficient for intercept. Suggest we get out and walk.++++@++++Jump, boy! I gotcha!
I'm comin'!++++@++++Now you, boy!
And what better place to premier their creation than on "The Tracey Ullman Show" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. On April 19th, 1987, America first met... the Simpsons.++++@++++Well, goodnight, son.
Um, Dad...++++@++++Yeah.
What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?++++@++++Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
Sweet dreams.++++@++++We may be the best parents in the world.
Goodnight, dear.++++@++++Goodnight.
All right, climb in.++++@++++There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
Yeow!++++@++++Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?
They're all gone. The whole batch.++++@++++Somebody ate those cookies.
Did you eat the cookies, Maggie.++++@++++I think she's trying to tell us something.
Go on Maggie.++++@++++Go on, Maggie. Go. Go.
renamed "Homer."++++@++++Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!
Gotta hide.++++@++++Bart! Where are ya, boy.
Over the six years "The Simpsons" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. Tonight we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes, "I think Homer gets stupider every year." That's not a question, Professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves.++++@++++Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name?++++@++++I don't know.
Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.++++@++++Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!
Well, duh.++++@++++Yabba dabba doo!
I'll take a hit, dealer. Joker? You're supposed to take those out of the deck!++++@++++Ooh, sorry. Here's another one.
The store is-a so rich, she'll-a never notice.++++@++++But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?
Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. Do you still work for NASA?++++@++++No, I work at the nuclear power plant.
Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil.++++@++++Woo hoo! Ow!
No, let me try the cup and ball.++++@++++No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'.
A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. Watch.++++@++++Bart, you're coming home.
Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game.++++@++++I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight.
Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh God, I gotta change that tape!++++@++++Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!
Hello, Muddah. Hello, Faddah. Here I am, at Camp Granada...++++@++++Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?
Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is egg nog.++++@++++'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!
Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up.++++@++++Oh, no, I'm not.
Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo.++++@++++Hey! I don't remember saying that!
What's wrong, honey?++++@++++Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.
Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that.++++@++++Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas...
I thought I told you: no returns for busted merchandise.++++@++++What are you doing to my son?!!
Goodnight.++++@++++I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months.
I always thought I understood my special little guy. But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.++++@++++Eh, what are you gonna do?
You guys made a snowman family?++++@++++Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!
You can't hide from me in this house, Bart! I spend 23 hours a day here!++++@++++Get 'im, Ma!
Does something smell funny in here?++++@++++I don't think so, stupid!
Homie, you want pork chops?++++@++++No, I want roast beef, you clod!
Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.++++@++++The All igh-ty ollar? I get it.
Gee, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?++++@++++Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
Awwww.++++@++++Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think.
That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. But who am I to complain?++++@++++I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
You're short one person.++++@++++Uh...
Okay, then, I just need your five hundred dollar registration fee.++++@++++Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?
No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!++++@++++Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!
It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.++++@++++Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars.
For what?++++@++++Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?
Leave the rag.++++@++++Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?
Pop 'n Fresh! You glutinous little doughboy! Oh, there's something I've wanted to do to you for years.++++@++++Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars.
Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.++++@++++Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us.
Well, that's a funny-looking strike.++++@++++C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO...
THEN BACK TO MY PLACE WHERE I WILL GET YOU BLOTTO...++++@++++DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO...
Ooh.++++@++++So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match.
Who knocked down the pins?++++@++++I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess.
Good for him!++++@++++Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me.
I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal!++++@++++But... but...
Ahh... We forfeit.++++@++++There it is, boys, the championship trophy!
Ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.++++@++++Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike.
Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?++++@++++Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!
Homer! Watch your mouth!++++@++++Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.
We are not wieners!++++@++++Then what are you dressed like that for?
They made us!++++@++++"They made us!" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!
Way to go, Homer! We win again! Good job! Etc.++++@++++By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer...
Listen here... I want to join your team.++++@++++You want to join my what?
Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything.++++@++++Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no.
So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?++++@++++Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that...
I've always been wealthy , but this is the first time I ever felt rich.++++@++++Awww.
Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me...++++@++++You're off the team.
Nice one, Homer.++++@++++Thanks.
Next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?++++@++++Goodbye, trophy.
Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!++++@++++I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back.
Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware, it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview!++++@++++Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
That's right, Dick. Y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: The absence of Mark Rodkin. Oh, wait, there he is.++++@++++Marge, I'm bored.
Why don't you read something?++++@++++Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
You'd get some fresh air and exercise.++++@++++Eh. I'll do it anyway.
Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?++++@++++It's easier. Duh.
Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?++++@++++Uh, spray the boy.
That fancy house'll never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.++++@++++Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?
Who are you talking to, Homer?++++@++++The guy who doesn't live there.
Can we get rid of this "Ayatollah" T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago.++++@++++But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!
I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this.++++@++++Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing.
Who's "Disco Stu?"++++@++++Oh. I wanted to write "DISCO STUD" but I ran out of space. Not that "Disco Stu" didn't get his share of the action!
Hey, Disco Stu doesn't advertise.++++@++++Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that.
King of the neighborhood!++++@++++Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
Right here!++++@++++And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
I'll take that.++++@++++Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!...
We surrender!...++++@++++Spend some dough at Table Three!
Wow, a former president, living right across the street!++++@++++Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
Actually this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.++++@++++Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--
You didn't vote for anybody.++++@++++I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical.
That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray.++++@++++Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!
Sir, could you pop your hood?++++@++++Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!
Homie. As long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy.++++@++++Well, you can always depend on that.
And that's why your no good kids are running wild!++++@++++First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?++++@++++I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!
Okay is he expecting you?++++@++++You owe me an apology!
You wanna step back, sir. You're trampling the flowers.++++@++++Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp.
All right, mister. You want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.++++@++++Oh, I want trouble all right.
Then you're gonna get trouble.++++@++++No, you're gonna get trouble.
Well, that's good, that's good, 'cause I want trouble.++++@++++Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
Oh, yeah. Lots of trouble.++++@++++Trouble it is.
Uh-unh, I'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. Staying right here 'til my speech to the Elks Club.++++@++++Yoo hoo?
Who is it?++++@++++It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!
Boys? Where you going?++++@++++Okay, son! Give him the glue!
President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.++++@++++He's not lost.
Looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.++++@++++It's time to hit him where he lives.
His house?++++@++++Bingo.
Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.++++@++++It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!
Hey, turkeys! Behind ya!++++@++++For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!
Never! You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs!++++@++++You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!
I just drop by with present for warming of house. Instead find you grappling with local oaf.++++@++++Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?
I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.++++@++++Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike.
Pleased to meet you. I just moved in. My name is Jerry Ford.++++@++++Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.
Say, Homer, do you like football?++++@++++Do I ever!
Do you like nachos?++++@++++Yes, Mr. Ford!
Well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos. And then some beer.++++@++++Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--
No, Grampa, don't!++++@++++Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--
Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs.++++@++++I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny.
Listen, I'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. But if you like to watch your TV -- and I mean really watch it -- you want: the CarnivalÃ©. It features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart...++++@++++Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies.
Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special.++++@++++Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.
Bart, comb your hair. Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.++++@++++But Sipowicz does it.
If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?++++@++++I wish I was Sipowicz.
Name, please?++++@++++Simpson family.
They're free to enjoy the club.++++@++++Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in.
That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til I paid him to stop.++++@++++You should've held out longer, boy.
Yes. They're better. Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join!++++@++++Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers.
You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score.++++@++++That's one way.
I'm the club pro, Tom Kite. How 'bout I give you a few pointers on your game? Now you don't want to over-think...++++@++++Not an issue.
Keep your head down.++++@++++Huh?
Wow! Very impressive! You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Really?
Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.++++@++++Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?
Yeah. Can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?++++@++++Seat down.
Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.++++@++++Yes.
Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!++++@++++Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge...
Oh, a cunning stratagem, Sir. It's curving right toward the green... and... it's... there.++++@++++He got to the green in one shot?!
Smithers, what are you doing up here?++++@++++And what are you doing with his ball?
There are no other balls. Uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! Ooh, step away, they're endangered!++++@++++These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!
Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh.++++@++++So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!
You know, Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, I'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight.++++@++++Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
Homer, what are you doing?++++@++++I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.
We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.++++@++++But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me "Sir," without adding "you're making a scene."
I won't say anything controversial.++++@++++I just won't say anything, okay, honey?
Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's... I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.++++@++++Our savings?!
Don't worry, I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel.++++@++++They have beer and gum, right?
May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your Great Aunt Hortense. As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate.++++@++++Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
No, it's a standard clause.++++@++++Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Fill out schedule B. You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.++++@++++Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
You gotta hand it to Krusty.++++@++++Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.
I can't believe Krusty is really gone.++++@++++Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead.
What kind of apprentice?++++@++++That's for my master to decide.
How about town crier? You'd be great at that.++++@++++You think so?
Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to.++++@++++Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot.
Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!++++@++++You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!
Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--++++@++++Less chat, more hat.
You're to restrict your cryering to the parade, and selected pre-approved publicity events.++++@++++Okay.
Toast.++++@++++I don't understand thee, Marge.
Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans SprÃ¼ngfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house fight!++++@++++No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?
He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.++++@++++Yes, that'd do.
He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!++++@++++The dastard!
Lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story.++++@++++I believe you, honey.
You do?++++@++++Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor.
That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me.++++@++++But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.
We could?++++@++++Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case.
Oh, you're back. And you've brought a friend.++++@++++Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife.
Hey, stop! I've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier, but this is well outside your jurisdiction.++++@++++Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!
Question: is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron?++++@++++No, it's Homer.
Well, then I will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, "Homer." And if I see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know that you stole my idea.++++@++++I'm just waitin' for my kid.
He wouldn't let me put it up.++++@++++Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention...
Well, yes, but human decency prevents--++++@++++DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!
Credibility.++++@++++What a jip.
I was so sure...++++@++++Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home.
By the power vested in me, I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--++++@++++No! Nooooooo!!
Oh, Dad, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade.++++@++++Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away.
Well, hey, it's Homer! Good to see ya, neighb--++++@++++Get lost!
Our first race is a benefit for daredevil Lance Murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !++++@++++All right! Liver!
Yah. Now I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs.++++@++++Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?
Montgomery Burns' office... Oh, hello Mrs. Burns... I'll see if your son is available.++++@++++Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!
Uh-huh... Okay, I'll give him the message. Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for having that affair with President Taft.++++@++++Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog...
Simpson, eh?++++@++++Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties.
Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty is giving you the most trouble?++++@++++Um, what do I do in case of fire?
Sorry, can't hear you. Bye-bye!++++@++++Just my luck.
Good lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation.++++@++++Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson.
Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.++++@++++But I think the dodo went extinct...
Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills.++++@++++Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?
Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. "Little Rascals" isn't on 'til 6.++++@++++I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
Eh? What about my options?++++@++++Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.
Did you get that report on the accounting department?++++@++++Yes, Sir, I did.
Is it about my cube?++++@++++It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!++++@++++Yes! Yes, sir!
Now get cracking on my long division. And don't forget to show your work, Simpson.++++@++++I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir.
Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax.++++@++++No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division.
The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it.++++@++++Yello?... It's for you.
Except...++++@++++Except... I killed Mr. Burns.
What happened, Dad?++++@++++I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
No, please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be.++++@++++Yes, sir.
Now I can make my escape...++++@++++Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?
Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself.++++@++++Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock.
Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is 5-2-4-6. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy.++++@++++Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?
Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers... you're no longer needed at all. You're fired. Ta!++++@++++You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
Cheer up, Homie.++++@++++I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.
I look forward to working with you!++++@++++Mr. Smithers, wait!
Mr. Burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. But I'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother.++++@++++You're on.
Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him, I'll rush in and save the day.++++@++++Got it.
Ahoy-hoy? Hoy?++++@++++Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother.
Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. And she doesn't call her son Mr. Burns!++++@++++Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!
Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers! You must have put him up to it! I'm glad I fired you.++++@++++You really blew it this time, Smithers.
Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson.++++@++++Okay.
It's for you.++++@++++I'll show you.
What did you get that for?++++@++++For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.
Did he die?++++@++++What am I -- a doctor?
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.++++@++++Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer.
I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. Homer, you go, too.++++@++++Oh, why can't they just take the gun?
Save our seats!++++@++++Will do.
The mouse.++++@++++Oh. I guess that's not him then.
Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. And Dad's upstairs.++++@++++Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.
Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?++++@++++All right... Wait a minute. For what?
To pay for a lawyer for my bum.++++@++++Forget it.
That does it. One of them has to go.++++@++++Okay. Grampa.
I've got it! Dad, give me $750!++++@++++Okay.
Well, first off, here's your $1,000 back for hiring that lawyer. And $750 for the drawing. And here's a couple of bucks for your trouble.++++@++++Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!
Dad, can we have $183,000?++++@++++What for?
Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.++++@++++Oh... Forget it.
Dad, what's a "muppet?"++++@++++Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know.
That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!++++@++++Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?
Hey, Homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy McClure?++++@++++Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.
This play has everything!++++@++++Oh, I love legitimate theater.
Oh... well... thank you...++++@++++Down in front!
Oh, come on. Guess which one.++++@++++I know! I know! It's Selma, right?
It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.++++@++++That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle.
What?!! Oh, my God!++++@++++Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep.
I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.++++@++++'Cause they won't hire an assistant.
No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?++++@++++This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
Maybe we can make your job more fun... What are those?++++@++++I don't know.
I'm going after him!++++@++++Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!
Hello?... Oh, Homie, hello! I can't remember the last time you called me from -- Oh, you want to speak to Lisa?++++@++++Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?
I'm learning about owls.++++@++++Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me...
Security guards?++++@++++Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?
Why do you need me?++++@++++Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?
Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles? Skittles? Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?++++@++++They all have hilarious names and are delicious.
We could have a slumber party.++++@++++Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store.
Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first.++++@++++Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.
Who do you love most: me, Bart, or Maggie?++++@++++All right, dare.
Okay... Why don't you...++++@++++Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?
Hmmm... Truth.++++@++++Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?
Dad, you tell everybody everything. Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist.++++@++++Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets.
Langdon Alger.++++@++++I have no idea who that is.
Nobody does! He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. But that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!++++@++++I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?
Whee.++++@++++What's wrong, honey?
There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret.++++@++++Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend.
Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart.++++@++++I promise.
Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong.++++@++++Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?
No, no! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you.++++@++++Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?
It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb.++++@++++Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge...
...and Bart could be the courier!++++@++++Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console.
No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!++++@++++Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.
...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?++++@++++Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
No! Old people deserve our respect! Look at Jacques Cousteau and Goldie Hawn. You wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.++++@++++Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet.
Lemme in! Someone's trying to kill me! Sweet Merciful McGillicuddy, ya gotta open the door!++++@++++Who is it?
But where are we going to put him?++++@++++Bart's room.
Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast!++++@++++Where are you two going at this hour?
On a treasure hunt.++++@++++Oh, can I come?
Only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your manhood to the ultimate test, and take--++++@++++Pass.
Well, things were bad everywhere.++++@++++I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen.++++@++++Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?
Hey, Homer, that's a pretty catchy chant. Where'd you learn it?++++@++++Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year.
I phoned ahead.++++@++++Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears.
That's specious reasoning, Dad.++++@++++Thank you, Honey.
By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.++++@++++Oh, how does it work?
It doesn't work.++++@++++Uh-huh.
It's just a stupid rock.++++@++++Uh-huh.
But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?++++@++++Lisa, I want to buy your rock.
Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.++++@++++Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.
That's the Home-Owner Tax.++++@++++Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.
I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad.++++@++++Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn.
Ah... Mr. Simpson? It may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant.++++@++++You? Pfft. I don't believe it.
Oh, I wish... Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.++++@++++Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about.
Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language.++++@++++Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.
Hey there, Homer, how's it hangin'?++++@++++Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again.
Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The NY Mets are my favorite squadron.++++@++++Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue.
I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself.++++@++++Don't forget Ganesha.
I cannot deny my roots and I can not keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land, where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from Green Bay.++++@++++Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!
Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?++++@++++No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake.
That's nice, although three of you are below voting age.++++@++++And I'm not registered!
Oh no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history.++++@++++Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor.
It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.++++@++++Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
Because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico became a state but before Arizona did.++++@++++Uh... partial credit.
...Executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial.++++@++++No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college.
Please, Mr. Simpson, my brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me.++++@++++Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history.
Dude, Karma.++++@++++What?
You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants -- except Native Americans.++++@++++Yeah, native Americans like us.
No, I mean--++++@++++Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker.
He's right! / You said it, Homer! / etc.++++@++++When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote "NO" on Proposition 24!
"Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."++++@++++Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!
Hullabalooza is a music festival -- the greatest music festival of all time.++++@++++I'm watching the road, sweetie. "You jiiive turkey!" See? You got to "sass" it. "Quit jiiiving me, turkey!" You gotta "sass" it. A turkey is a bad person.
Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir? Can you please change the radio station?++++@++++But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?
Dad, please. You're embarrassing us.++++@++++No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music.
Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!++++@++++I'm just trying to party with you guys.
Oldies.++++@++++Oldies?
Karma. Karma.++++@++++There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival.
The what festival?++++@++++The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.
Wicked!++++@++++Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible.
Sandra, that was mean.++++@++++But most of all, I remember the music.
It's called rocking out.++++@++++You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it.
I used to be "with it." But then they changed what "it" was. Now what I'm with isn't "it," and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you.++++@++++No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever...
What's wrong, Homie?++++@++++I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy.
Before we start -- We have a lost child here. If she is not claimed within the next hour, she will become the property of Blockbuster Entertainment.++++@++++That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!
Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse!++++@++++I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic refreshment, eat Clark Bars. And for totally outrageous class rings, it's Josten's. Gooooo, Josten's!++++@++++You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!
People, have your tickets out. Throw your cameras out. Surrender all identification.++++@++++Oh, my homemade Kahlua.
Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people.++++@++++Hey, a freak show!
It smells like Otto's jacket.++++@++++Oh, I get it.
Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!++++@++++Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born.
Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.++++@++++Well, excuuuuuuse me!
You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while.++++@++++Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people.
Where's the Narc! / Who? / That fat Jamaican guy.++++@++++What did I say? What's going on?
Don't commit your hate crimes here. Hate crime!++++@++++Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!
Dad, are you okay?++++@++++I'm fine.
So you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.++++@++++I don't think I have a choice, Marge.
Of course you have a choice.++++@++++How do you figure?
You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.++++@++++You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people...
And now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!++++@++++Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?
Hey, Cannonball -- I like your statement: When life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins.++++@++++Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide.
Dear Bart and Lisa...++++@++++All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...
I don't even know anymore.++++@++++Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!
Hey -- I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the Audio Visual Club.++++@++++Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.
Alright, Homer! / etc.++++@++++That was odd.
Gee. I don't like the sound of that.++++@++++No biggie. I'm cool.
My God. Those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. From now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals.++++@++++Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.
Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to the gut... you will die!++++@++++Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?
So what's it like being famous, Dad?++++@++++People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great.
Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?++++@++++Nope.
What religion are you?++++@++++You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity.
Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?++++@++++Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do.
Do... wait... Do you... do you feel... do... do you feel...? oh, come on... Do you feel?++++@++++...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
I used to carpool with that guy.++++@++++Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper.
You're the coolest dad alive!++++@++++Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich.
Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. I expect your letter of resignation on my desk.++++@++++You have a desk?
I mean the hood of my car.++++@++++I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for.
Dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool.++++@++++You know what the song says, "It's hip to be square."
That song is so lame.++++@++++So lame that it's cool?
Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here.++++@++++Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool.
Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again.++++@++++Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little.
Maybe you're getting stronger.++++@++++Well, I have been eating more...
Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree.++++@++++Bye-bye, job.
No, Springfield is "America's crud-bucket." At least according to Newsweek.++++@++++"Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons." Oh, geez. He actually wrote "diddly."
That was thoughtful.++++@++++I left a few helpful notes around the house...
Put food in me.++++@++++I'll take that.
Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date!++++@++++Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge.
How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends?++++@++++You've got friends. You got "The Dud" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!
Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it.++++@++++All right.
Check this out: "Miss Perfect Attendance".++++@++++This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches.
Fresh out.++++@++++No lighter?... Nothin'?
This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --++++@++++Sweet merciful crap! My car!
Homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know.++++@++++Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it.
What's up there? / Is it a monster? / We have to know! / What's the secret?++++@++++No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
Three! We have three kids, Homer!++++@++++Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?
So I have two brothers?++++@++++Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity.
But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town, the child was an outcast. So we did the only humane thing.++++@++++We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
We've got to find Hugo.++++@++++We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to.
I'll start with Radio Shack.++++@++++Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
Your micro-jerks attacked me!++++@++++Lookin' good, son.
This is a mission of conquest. Take us to your leader.++++@++++I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C.
President Clin-Ton. Excellent.++++@++++Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole.
Commence bio-duplication.++++@++++Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!
What? Are you still here? I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of you.++++@++++No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?
That's Slick Willie for you. Always with the smooth talk.++++@++++Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!
Sure you were, rummy.++++@++++That's one of the creatures!
Well, a refreshingly frank response there from Senator Bob Dole.++++@++++These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!
My fellow Americans: as a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But tonight I say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!++++@++++Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
I am so mad at the secret service right now. Hey, who the hell are you?++++@++++I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!
I am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath.++++@++++America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!
Ow! I don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet I never even heard of.++++@++++Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.
You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?++++@++++Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?
We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library cards... Bart's lawyer is here.++++@++++But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream.
What lifelong dream?++++@++++Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
Homer, I don't want to leave Springfield. I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to hoist myself out of it.++++@++++Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look.
Cypress Creek. A tale of one city...++++@++++Ah, let's watch something else.
Homer! You're trying to talk us into moving to this place.++++@++++Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this.
Your dreams may vary from those of Globex Corporation, its subsidiaries, and shareholders.++++@++++Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?
Hello. I am not interested in buying the house, but I would like to use your restroom, flip through your magazines, re-arrange your carefully shelved items, and handle your food products in an unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels.++++@++++Thank you! Come again!
Even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage.++++@++++Heeeeey...
Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?++++@++++Yes.
Oh... uh...++++@++++Okily dokily.
Haw-haw.++++@++++I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
Oooh!++++@++++Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home.
I am here to welcome you on behalf of the President of the Globex Corporation, me. Try the papayas. They're juicy and full of papayine. Makes you strong. Like Popeye. Popeye, papayine. Popeye, papayine. See, same thing? Same... Ah, forget it. How are ya? I'm Hank Scorpio.++++@++++Wow! My boss!
Aw sure, I come later in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations. But I don't like the word "boss". Hey, look at my feet.++++@++++Okay...
Ha! Ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?++++@++++Yes, once.
See you at work tomorrow! Although I don't really like to call it "work"!++++@++++Wowww.
You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here.++++@++++Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.
Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat.++++@++++Wow.
Having a place like this has always been my dream, Homer. What's your dream?++++@++++Uh... to work for you?
Don't do that. My butt is for sitting, not for kissing. Now you tell me the truth -- What's your real dream? Your real dream?++++@++++Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.
I bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.++++@++++Yeah.
Homer, don't give up. They laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat. I was the first wealthy man in America to ever do that. Now they all do it!... Didja ever hear of Mike Milken?++++@++++Ye... No.
Now Homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give them the benefit of your years of experience.++++@++++Don't worry. That won't take long.
I want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and I'll catch you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?++++@++++All right.
One second... Hello?++++@++++Doh!
Yes sir, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Could you, um... work any harder than this?
Sure thing, boss.++++@++++Hey, call me Homer.
I moved here from Canada and they think I'm slow, eh?++++@++++Hey, what's with you sad sacks?
Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!++++@++++Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! "To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."
Why don't you buy it?++++@++++I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
I'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. We've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line.++++@++++Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks.
Oh, hi, Homer! What can I do for you?++++@++++All right... What's the number?
There's "Hammocks-R-Us"...++++@++++Got it...
That's on Third, too. You got "Put Your Butt There"...++++@++++Umm-hmmm...
That's on Third.++++@++++Yes...
"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"...++++@++++Right...
That might... Matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. It's the Hammock Complex, down on Third?++++@++++Oh, the Hammock District.
Uh, Homer. One second. I gotta take care of this. Very important. 'Be right back.++++@++++Fine.
Back to the hammocks, my friend.++++@++++Yes.
You know who invented the hammock, Homer?++++@++++No?
That's something for you to do. Find that out.++++@++++Any sugar around here?
Hi, Homer! I'm keeping two of my fingers crossed that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow.++++@++++Uh... yessir. No problemo.
Good. By the way, Homer, what's your least favorite country, Italy or France?++++@++++France.
Nobody ever says Italy.++++@++++I've never noticed this office before.
Why should you? -- It's mine.++++@++++Eh, you have any sugar around here?
Here you go. Sorry it's not in packages. Want some cream?++++@++++Eh... I... no.
Stop him! He's supposed to die!++++@++++Aargh!
Nice work, Homer. Am I prouda you!++++@++++Well...
I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much.++++@++++Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school.
We want to go back to Springfield.++++@++++What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions.
T minus 1 minute 35 seconds.++++@++++Uh, I've got a problem, Hank.
Aw, gee, Homer, could it wait a sec, please?++++@++++Well, it's pretty important.
I'm having a little trouble with the government.++++@++++Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government.
What's the problem?++++@++++Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield.
What's bothering them?++++@++++Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
Homer, I'm disappointed, but I think you need to do what's best for your family.++++@++++Well... Thanks for everything, Hank.
Telegram.++++@++++"Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."
I think owning the Denver Broncos is pretty good.++++@++++Yeah yeah.
Well explain to me why it isn't.++++@++++You just don't understand football, Marge.
Weren't there three Indians last year?++++@++++Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!
No, I don't.++++@++++Like bull you don't! Come on!
Homer, please, you're hurting my arm!++++@++++No, I'm not!
Night vision goggles? A bathroom scale from a Soviet sub? A suede briefcase-case? Oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems...++++@++++Marge, look!
Some bullies beat me up and took it.++++@++++Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.
But then they'll just beat me up even worse.++++@++++Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents.
This is for the crummy life I've had to live!++++@++++The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down.++++@++++Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
There ya go! That's the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! Y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!++++@++++Really?
Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!++++@++++Dressing?
Their choice.++++@++++You really think I could do it?
Well, I dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?++++@++++Yes!
And are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?++++@++++Yes!
And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?++++@++++YES!!
I'll take it!!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career, I wantcha to have complete faith in me. C'mere, lemme show ya somethin'...++++@++++Wow! I've never been in here before!
Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office.++++@++++You used to be a boxer just like me?
Yep. They called me "Kid Gorgeous." Later on, it was "Kid Presentable." Then "Kid Gruesome." And finally, "Kid Moe."++++@++++Hey, what's this?
Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out.++++@++++You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too.
Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time.++++@++++Why not?
'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics...++++@++++Lousy Democrats.
Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor.++++@++++No problemo.
You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "Homer Simpson's Syndrome."++++@++++Oh, why me?
Oooo-kay... Let's see the right.++++@++++Just a second.
When you're ready...++++@++++All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...
Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching.++++@++++Then I can just push him over.
Who's gonna knock you down?++++@++++No one.
When are you gonna fight back?++++@++++Never.
What are you gonna do?++++@++++Nothing.
Okay. You're fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.++++@++++Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?
Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with 'em than I did.++++@++++Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?
I gotta be honest with ya, Homer. I didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper.++++@++++You... didn't?
No. Homer, how would you like to be Heavyweight Champion of the World?++++@++++Uh, sure.
Great. All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum. It's this Saturday. Here's your parking pass.++++@++++Ooh, "General!" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?
Uh, you know what? I'm gonna have to check on that...++++@++++Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance.
Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?++++@++++Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!
Have you lost your mind?!++++@++++Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --
But you'll get killed!++++@++++Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --
Mom's right, Dad. The odds against you winning are a thousand to one.++++@++++Well, I don't think it's that unlikely.
Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.++++@++++All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today.
All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?++++@++++Gotcha.
Due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem. And now, Ladies and gentlemen, LET'S GET READY TO RUM-BLE!!!++++@++++Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--
Oh, my God! Simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting him out! Ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is literally flying out the window!++++@++++Are you an angel?
Yes, Homer, I'm an angel. All us angels wear Farah slacks.++++@++++But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?
Oh, Homie, are you okay?++++@++++I can't remember where we parked.
I got your tooth, Dad!++++@++++Eh, not mine.
Well, so long, Springfield...++++@++++Where are you going?
I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the World Series!++++@++++Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.
Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?++++@++++Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary!++++@++++Can't they get a pole for that sign?
That's a hitchhiker, Homer.++++@++++Ooh, let's pick him up!
No! What if he's crazy?++++@++++And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
We're not picking him up!++++@++++Oh, yes we are!
There's not enough room!++++@++++Oh, yes, there is!
I just don't think it's a good idea.++++@++++And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final.
He stole my fiancÃ©e.++++@++++He made fun of my weight.
Hey, relax. I don't wanna work. I'm so lazy, I took lessons on the player piano.++++@++++Wow, that's really lazy.
Lazy? You're not kidding. I'm like a rug on Valium, I'm talkin' lazy.++++@++++So lazy.
I see. Well, I... Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation. I wonder how much I should give...++++@++++...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!
I think we heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.++++@++++Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
Oh, "yakkety-yak-yak"... You, Foodbag -- do you have a son?++++@++++Yes, sir. I do.
And is he a constant disappointment? Does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them?++++@++++Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who...
I'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!++++@++++Eh, I should go.
Sheesh, Dad and I, we started out great, but now it's fallin' apart, like a Chinese motorcycle.++++@++++It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.
Yeah. I tell ya, I don't get no regard, no regard at all. No esteem, either.++++@++++Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping.
Yeah, right. I dunno, maybe I should just leave town.++++@++++Pho-ny kid-napping...
What are you doing in the basement? It's like you're hiding out down here.++++@++++Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books.
And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?++++@++++Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
Ahoy-hoy?++++@++++Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?
Yes! I'm missing one son! Return it immediately!++++@++++If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today.
Oh, how much proof do you need? Five thousand? Six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got.++++@++++Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!
More important than money? Who is this?++++@++++Just a second.
Can't we just go upstairs?++++@++++No!
Kidnapped?!++++@++++Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love.
You know how I feel about hoaxes!++++@++++Still?
I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble.++++@++++What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!
We gotta find someplace to hide!++++@++++The abandoned warehouse!
Drive faster, Grandma! Grandma's gaining on us!++++@++++Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here.
Some people are trying to watch the movie!++++@++++You don't like it, call the cops!
With pleasure, sir.++++@++++Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.
And where is all that liquor coming from?++++@++++It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense.
Da-ad! V-chip, V-chip!++++@++++Sorry, sorry. My fault.
We interrupt this cartoon for a Special Report.++++@++++Someone found my keys!
Now, the cat needs his medication every morning --++++@++++No problem... Can do.
And the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--++++@++++Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.
Woo hoo!++++@++++A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.
What time?++++@++++You know, I don't know.
Shall we say ten?++++@++++All right. Just wake me up.
Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?++++@++++No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.
Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?++++@++++Do I have to sit up?
Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very valuable stone gargoyle, and... are you wearing a grocery bag?++++@++++I have misplaced my pants.
I'm not going to press charges, but I assume you'll want to punish him.++++@++++'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him.
Well, if you won't discipline him, I'll come back and speak with his mother.++++@++++No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day.
She makes me taste beer.++++@++++C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit.
It's eleven o'clock. Do you know where your children are?++++@++++I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten.
I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Bart was filling in for --++++@++++I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
Oh, I agree. Kids need rules and boundaries.++++@++++Yes, everyone loves rules...
It's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs...++++@++++Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs.
This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?++++@++++Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?
That's true, but I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there.++++@++++Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that.
Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!++++@++++Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's...
"Maison Derriere"?! I can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart to work there?++++@++++No! I only learned that four days ago.
What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?++++@++++I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!
Dad, we can't let this happen to Belle! Do something!++++@++++Don't you worry, son.
Please hurry.++++@++++Sure, we could tear this house down...
Stop! No!++++@++++What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?
Chip!++++@++++Take it off!
All right, Dad, you've been warned. Let's go.++++@++++Hey...
C'mon...++++@++++Easy...
Is it really necessary to watch TV while we're eating? We're getting food all over.++++@++++Yoink.
Hello Marge. How's the family? I don't want to talk about it. Mind your own business.++++@++++Keep it down in there, everybody.
Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?++++@++++Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.
Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party.++++@++++Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up.
Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?++++@++++Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?
Well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.++++@++++Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.
Are you ready?++++@++++I just gotta put my shoes on.
Huh. I should have asked them to hurl some bacon, then maybe I coulda had a decent breakfast for once.++++@++++You know what you two need? A little comic strip called "Love Is." It's about two naked eight year olds who are married.
Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story. It's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory...++++@++++Boring!
A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence...++++@++++Ooh, here we go!
It's a door. Use it!++++@++++That's a door?
Oh, okay. Ta-ta, I'm off to the beauty salon.++++@++++G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well.
I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party.++++@++++Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.
I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They were so insulting: "You are a coward." No one likes to hear that after a nice meal.++++@++++You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.
Uh, singles life is great, Homer. I can do whatever I want. Today I drank a beer in the bathroom.++++@++++The one down the hall.
I sleep in a racing car. Do you?++++@++++I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
That's Jerry. He's a major player down at the sewing store.++++@++++Thanks for introducing me.
Homer, get ready!++++@++++For what?
Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray.++++@++++I don't wanna go to that.
You said you'd do it as a favor to me.++++@++++That doesn't sound like something I'd say.
Fine. I'll go without you.++++@++++Okay. Love you.
Oh! My demo tape!++++@++++Can I Borrow A Feeling? "Can I Borrow A Feeling?" There's your picture on the front.
Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me.++++@++++I already did.
You know why all this happened, don't you? 'Cause I took my marriage for granted. Y'know, in twelve years, I never once helped out with the housework.++++@++++Oh yeah. You gotta do that.
I could've at least stayed in shape for her.++++@++++Oh, and for yourself.
I could've taken just a little time to... to make her feel special.++++@++++It can't just be sex. It can't.
God, I was so self-centered. No wonder I didn't see it coming. That's how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.++++@++++Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me.
Oh, how do you know? What makes you guys so special?++++@++++'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
Hi, Dad. You know, there's buns in the cabinet.++++@++++Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage.
Oh, okay. Can I stay up?++++@++++All right.
You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now?++++@++++'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
You mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?++++@++++Mm-hm.
She knows.++++@++++Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot.
You're very lucky to have Mom.++++@++++That's your advice?! Go to bed!
Homie, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep.++++@++++Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you.
None! They would have more sense than that.++++@++++Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.
Only three cavities, Bart. Your best check-up ever. I'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken.++++@++++Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.
Why? Am I pregnant?++++@++++No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you.
Oh, Homie. I know you love me. We don't need to get married again.++++@++++Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon.
Dearly beloved --++++@++++Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.
I will now read the special vows which Homer has prepared for this occasion. Do you Marge take Homer, in richness and in poorness?... Poorness is underlined... In impotence and in potence? In quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered monkey-navigated -- And it goes on like this.++++@++++It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
Good morning. One donut with sprinkles, and... Wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, Sir!++++@++++Whaddya mean?
You have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!++++@++++Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was.
Ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. Frankly, I would've expected better from Jimmy the Scumbag.++++@++++Hey, what's this thing?
Huh? Oh, that's an auto-dialer. This bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide.++++@++++Telemarketing, eh?
An automatic dialer? Is that legal? I don't want you getting arrested, Homer...++++@++++I won't.
Or swindling our neighbors.++++@++++Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.
Hmm. One dollar for eternal happiness... Mmmm, I'd be happier with the dollar.++++@++++Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!++++@++++Tele-panhandling.
Why it's the AT-5000 Autodialer, my very first patent! Aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! It's sad and alarming. You were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. Well, let's get you home to Frinky. Hope your wheels still work.++++@++++Oh, no you don't!
That is it, Ned! If you don't unplug that phone right now, you're sleeping on the lawn!++++@++++Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!
Lisa! The cops are chasing me. I need a place to hide!++++@++++Lisa's window is the next one!
Ned, did you plug that phone back in?!++++@++++Shut up!!
Well, that thing's been drivin' the whole town nuts! Got me out of the bath seven times. Seven!++++@++++Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?
Dad, wake up!++++@++++... Is it... Wah?
I think a hurricane is coming!++++@++++Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield.
Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra.++++@++++Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel.
No, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--++++@++++I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage.++++@++++Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!
Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?++++@++++Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
It's dying down!++++@++++All clear, everyone.
Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane.++++@++++Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
The hurricane's over.++++@++++He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!
Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for.++++@++++Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.++++@++++Talk to me!!
Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left.++++@++++Well, call us if you need anything.
Glad to do it. / Sure. / Happy to help out. / Etc.++++@++++Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love.
Uh-huh. Ooh, looks like a loose nail.++++@++++Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad.
Well, I've seen about enough.++++@++++So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?
Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met.++++@++++Hey, I got off pretty easy.
The man who lived next door until his house blew down.++++@++++Oh, him.
Homer, can you be that annoying?++++@++++I... What?
Mmm. He's not responding. Proceed to Level Two Antagonism.++++@++++Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
Ah, he's still repressing. Maximum hostility factor.++++@++++I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?
Ho ho ho. Very funny, wise guy.++++@++++Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly.
Hi, neighbor!++++@++++You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human.
Um, did you like it?++++@++++C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?
Mmm, mmm. 'Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm. Satisfying.++++@++++What about, uh, fluorescent lights?
Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light.++++@++++See? You like everything.
Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains.++++@++++Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?
Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco.++++@++++You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
No, Homie, wait!++++@++++What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!
Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer.++++@++++Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?
Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. "Or-uh-GAHN-o?" What the hell...?++++@++++Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!
Remember your promise: no drinking.++++@++++Stupor Pooper.
They say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon.++++@++++Five-alarm chili, eh?
Um-hm.++++@++++One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?
Woo-woo!++++@++++Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh.
That Simpson, he thinks he's the Pope of Chilitown. Well, this year I am ready for him!++++@++++Hello, Chief.
Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum.++++@++++Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold.
You promised you wouldn't drink!++++@++++But I need it!
You don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?++++@++++Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do.
His ears if we're lucky!++++@++++Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is.
You are on a quest for knowledge.++++@++++Who said that?
Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide.++++@++++Hiya.
There is a lesson you must learn.++++@++++If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you.
No, I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once.++++@++++Yeah, that's me all right.
Clarity is the path to inner peace.++++@++++But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?
Are you kidding? If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer!++++@++++You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!
Sorry. I am a coyote...++++@++++Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya.
Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well: To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate.++++@++++Soul mate?
Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding.++++@++++That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge.
Is it?++++@++++Hey, wait! Come back!...
Hey, get off the course, you bum! Security!++++@++++Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!
Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate.++++@++++Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog.
So then I says to Mabel, I says...++++@++++Hi, kids.
I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad.++++@++++Where's your mother?
So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says...++++@++++Hi, honey.
I'm "cranky" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer.++++@++++Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate.
Don't "soul mate" me!++++@++++Okay.
Okay, but I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum.++++@++++Well what about you, Lenny?
Find your soul mate, Homer. Find your soul mate.++++@++++Where? Where?!
Either that or Batman has really let himself go.++++@++++Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!
Aye... the hotpants.++++@++++Well, I won't be lonely for long....
Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe!++++@++++Marge?
I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried...++++@++++Really? You were? But how did you find me?
Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron...++++@++++Or that little guy on the "Don't Walk" sign.
...we had a fight?++++@++++Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus...
...and you're from Mars.++++@++++Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters.
Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep...++++@++++...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
...a profound mystical understanding?++++@++++Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!
Space coyote?++++@++++Omigod! The ship!
We'll all be killed!++++@++++The light! We gotta get the light back on!
We did it!++++@++++We sure did... soul mate.
But Homer, it's ten in the morning.++++@++++Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called "The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down." First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so...
Another Duff, Homer?++++@++++Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special.
Uh, here you go. DÃ¼ff. From Sweden.++++@++++Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!
Ah, ha ha, you got me, didn't ya? All right, here you go -- "Red Tick Beer."++++@++++Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on.
Just a second, Homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home.++++@++++Eh, I guess I'll walk home.
Oh, son, I'm glad to see ya. I went for the morning paper and I got lost, and...++++@++++No time for you, old man!
Aww.++++@++++Please, don't hurt me!
Don't be afraid.++++@++++Yaaaa...
Homer, it's two a.m.! What happened?++++@++++It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, "Don't be afraid!"
Have you been drinking?++++@++++No! Well, ten beers...
Maybe you just dreamed it.++++@++++Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!
Dad, according to "Junior Skeptic Magazine" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.++++@++++So?
I am the thing from Uranus!++++@++++Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
It's your birthday?++++@++++Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?
Good doggy. Good doggy!++++@++++Lousy loveable dog.
Well, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass... I mean, uh, Simpson. So I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter.++++@++++You don't have to humiliate me.
Yo!++++@++++No, I'm sorry.
Now we're going to run a few tests. This is a simple lie-detector. I'll ask you a few yes-or-no questions and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand?++++@++++Yes.
All right, Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.++++@++++Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.++++@++++We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
It's not a monster! It's Mr. Burns!++++@++++I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!
I don't believe you, Homer.++++@++++You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!
You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear.++++@++++Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.
Homer, please! I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. Please just let it be.++++@++++No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?
Please, let's just go to sleep.++++@++++No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?
No, I'm not.++++@++++Well then, good night!
Hey, Dad. What's the word from Planet Crackpot?++++@++++Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too.
Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.++++@++++You do?
Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.++++@++++Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?
Hell, yes.++++@++++That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!
What if we don't?++++@++++We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
They'll buy anything!++++@++++Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?++++@++++Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?
And that is how much college will cost for Maggie!++++@++++No! No! No-o-o-o-o!
You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here.++++@++++Yeah, me too.
I bring you peace.++++@++++As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say...
Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.++++@++++Good work, son! We did it! We did it!
I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.++++@++++Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?
Yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?++++@++++Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
Is the alien Santa Claus?++++@++++Uh, yes.
Uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?++++@++++This interview is over!
Surprise me!++++@++++Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any "Homer is a Dope" T-shirts, do you?
These shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! And look at the fine stitching on "Dope!"++++@++++I'll take two!
Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie.++++@++++Thanks, Marge.
...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?
Well, maybe it's all for the best...++++@++++What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about.
Well, that's the miracle of the franchise. You get all the equipment and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand name people trust. You'll be on a rocket ride to the moon. And while you're there, would you pick up some of that nice green moon money for me, Royce McCutcheon.++++@++++No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!
Marge.++++@++++Oh yeah.
Did you know that disco record sales were up 400% for the year ending 1976? If these trends continue, aaaayyyyyy...++++@++++Uh, your fish are dead.
Don't forget fat people. They can't stop eating!++++@++++Hey, pretzels!
Here? Our plant?++++@++++That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way.
Oh, cheer up, Mom. You can't buy publicity like that. Thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford.++++@++++You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.
Of course. Right this way.++++@++++Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate.
Hello? Uh, no, Pretzel Wagon's no longer -- Three hundred pretzels?! Wait, wait, let me get this down. Mmm... Mmm... Meatpackers Union Hall... Batavia, New York... I'll send them right out! Homer, Homie, wake up! Wake up, I'm back in business!++++@++++I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey.
Here you go, Homer.++++@++++Thanks, Moe.
Hey, wait a minute -- this is real money!++++@++++Yeah, my wife is raking it in.
Greetings, Homer.++++@++++Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?
Now, the time has come for you to do us a favor.++++@++++You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir.
Homer, did you tell the Mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?++++@++++In those words? Yes.
Oh, it just sickens me. How could you do this to someone you love?++++@++++How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.
Oh, Homer, I know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the Mafia's not getting one cent of my money!++++@++++So what are we gonna do?
I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies: "Where's the money?," "When are you going to get the money?," "Why aren't you getting the money now?," and so on. So please, the money.++++@++++You heard her. She said "no."
Homie, maybe we should go inside.++++@++++But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.
Alright, popcorn's ready!++++@++++Hey, that's the fire alarm!
Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now.++++@++++I think I won, Mr. Burns.
Yes, you won all right. You won more than you bargained for.++++@++++Woo hoo!
No, you take that back!++++@++++Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!
Teamwork is overrated.++++@++++Huh?
Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?++++@++++Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway.
All right. Let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park. This will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. I cannot overemphasize the dangers which... did you bring your family, Simpson?++++@++++Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. The routes are treacherous, so use your maps.++++@++++Uh, I lost my map.
Now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious "World's Worst Employee" trophy.++++@++++Hey, this sounds like fun.
I've placed all your names in this hat--++++@++++Oooh.
Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?++++@++++Uh, not as such.
Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called "cheating".++++@++++Yes, lotta hysteria...
Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself.++++@++++Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!
Horseless sleigh.++++@++++Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns.
Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met.++++@++++No sir. I am not.
Now we have electricity. This propane tank will supply us with heat, and this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the cabin.++++@++++No going through the window for us!
Well, I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, Homie old boy. More champagne?++++@++++You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny.
Oh, yes, but I'd trade it all for a little more.++++@++++Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.
Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?++++@++++Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?
The only hard part is getting up.++++@++++Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.
Why, you'd have to get up.++++@++++Oh?
Sir, I am in your debt.++++@++++Use it wisely, my friend.
Hope that wasn't an avalanche. Be a chum and have a look-see.++++@++++You got it, buddy.
Isn't there any way out of here?++++@++++Um, I don't see one. Unless...
Simpson, I have a confession. I'm not quite the tunnel digger I made myself out to be.++++@++++You can supervise me.
What happened?++++@++++I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
We... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.++++@++++Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson.++++@++++So what?
We must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.++++@++++It could be days before they find us.
Ech! I heard that one 75 years ago.++++@++++We could build snowmen.
No, I have a better idea! We could build real men. Out of snow.++++@++++Oh... Okay.
I... I think we should dress the snowmen.++++@++++Agreed.
Look at them. Smug and secure in their finery. Mocking us.++++@++++Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns.
Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch. To watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down.++++@++++What do we do?
I'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery.++++@++++You and what army?
We'll be dashed to pieces.++++@++++Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house.
Oh, something's wrong with its brakes! Gangway!++++@++++Marge, kids.
Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.++++@++++You said it, ya weirdo.
It's my hair. Excuse me.++++@++++Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
All right... but don't be shocked.++++@++++Oh, There's no way I could --
Homie, I'm losing my hair.++++@++++Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!
I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.++++@++++Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it.
A nanny?!++++@++++But how am I supposed to pay for that?
And I'll take up smoking and give that up.++++@++++Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar.
But he didn't do anything!++++@++++Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!
Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need.++++@++++All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much.
Pleased to meet you.++++@++++Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!
Homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one.++++@++++Sorry.
I'm here about the nanny job. I'll keep a watchful eye on your kids, and if they get out of line-Pow!++++@++++I like him!
Thanks. Hey, where do you keep the liquor?++++@++++I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
That's Carl.++++@++++You have my undivided attention.
TEACH US SONGS AND MAGIC TRICKS.++++@++++MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
THE NANNY WE WANT IS KINDLY AND SAGE.++++@++++AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--
Hello. I'm Shary Bobbins.++++@++++Did you say Mary Pop--
No, I'm practically perfect in every way.++++@++++Well, so am I.
Lord and Lady Huffington of Sussex.++++@++++Marge, do we know them?
I make you read every article in that magazine, including Norman Mailer's latest claptrap about his waning libido.++++@++++Ooh, she is tough.
My, she seems too good to be true.++++@++++I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker. The kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. It's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!++++@++++Come to bed, Marge.
Ooooh.++++@++++No, no. Leave it in.
CAN I BE A BOOZEHOUND?++++@++++NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
Oh, thank you.++++@++++Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding.
The secret ingredient is blood.++++@++++Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you.
We'll miss you, Shary Bobbins.++++@++++You've changed me as well. I'm no longer the money-driven workaholic I once was.
Welcome back to "Before They Were Famous." We all know Rainier Wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster "McBain" movies. But here's his first appearance -- in a commercial in his native Austria.++++@++++Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!
Well you know, Homer -- IF THERE'S A JOB THAT MUST BE DONE / YOU'LL FIND IT'S MUCH MORE FUN.++++@++++You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
SEARCHING FOR MY LOST SHAKER OF SALT... OH, HERE IT IS.++++@++++Oh, that poor woman.
But haven't I taught you people anything?++++@++++Nope.
So you like it this way?++++@++++Indubitably!
THEY'RE NOT PERFECT, BUT THE LORD SAYS LOVE THY NEIGHBOR --++++@++++SHUT UP, FLANDERS.
Do you think we'll ever see her again?++++@++++I'm sure we will, honey.
'Morning, Roy!++++@++++Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie.
You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice.++++@++++I do not!
Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?++++@++++I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
Well, here. Say something.++++@++++Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' "Howdy" to all the girls out there in radioland.
Now that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next.++++@++++Oh, "no attitude," eh? Not "in-your-face," huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!
That's it! That's the Poochie attitude!! Do that again!++++@++++Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
Then you don't get the job. Next!++++@++++Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog.
That's it! You've got the job!++++@++++Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you.
Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice.++++@++++She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again.
Relax, Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy.++++@++++You? But you're a lady.
She's a lady, all right. A beauuutiful lady.++++@++++Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?
Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner -- "Meep!"++++@++++You mean "meep meep"?
You folks ready to begin?++++@++++Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy and Scratchy CD-Rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?++++@++++What the hell are you talking about?
Can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? Midge, help me out here.++++@++++Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
Eh, that stunk!++++@++++Well? What did everybody think?
Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer. You, uh... you got a beautiful home here.++++@++++So it was pretty okay, huh?
Yes we can!++++@++++Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?
Right on, Mr. S.!++++@++++Put a sock in it, Roy.
Are you prepared to die, Poochie?++++@++++No I am not.
Oh, cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Just stick to the script as written, Homer. You're supposed to say "Please, cut off my head, I don't deserve to live."++++@++++Never!
Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?++++@++++Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together.
I guess...++++@++++Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!
No refunds! Force majeure! Read the back of your ticket!++++@++++Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again.
I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.++++@++++That is so true.
Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!++++@++++What happened?
Oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! She thought that "Mindy" lived with "Mark!"++++@++++Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
We work hard, we play hard!++++@++++Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!
Oh, but this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator! Don't you just love the graphics on this box?++++@++++No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man.
It's camp! The tragically ludicrous? The ludicrously tragic?++++@++++Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies.
Well, sort of... But I mean more like inflatable furniture or "Last Supper" TV trays or even this bowling shirt. Can you believe someone gave this to Goodwill?++++@++++And that kind of stuff is worth money?
Boy howdy!++++@++++Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!
Well, if you're inviting me over --++++@++++I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?
Oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about this place! Well, I just love it!++++@++++Do I know you?
Oh!...++++@++++Ow! Why you little...
Dad! Dad! Company! Company!++++@++++Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat.
Oof! Homer, you are the living end!++++@++++That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer.++++@++++Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there...
Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?++++@++++Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
He prefers the company of men!++++@++++Who doesn't?
Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--++++@++++Right...
You're being ridiculous.++++@++++Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!
I'm very sorry you feel that way. Because John invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going.++++@++++Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way.
What on earth are you talking about?++++@++++You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming.
Homer, at least come out and say hello.++++@++++No! No, no, no, no...
Come on. You liked John this morning.++++@++++No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!
Oh, geez Louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. John's a witty, urbane person.++++@++++Oh, and I'm not.
Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!++++@++++Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
I'unno. Came outta the closet.++++@++++Uhh... huh.
So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?++++@++++Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?
I don't, but I loved hearing it!++++@++++You! I should have known!
Homer, John brought us cactus candy!++++@++++Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!
Well, now you don't get any candy. No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece.++++@++++No.
Homer, what have you got against gays?++++@++++You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!
Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself.++++@++++No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just...
Queer?++++@++++Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent "you people" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!
What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?++++@++++Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
What am I supposed to do here?++++@++++Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.++++@++++That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?
Anything slim!++++@++++Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will...
Roscoe.++++@++++Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.
Why the hell would I want to see that?++++@++++You'll thank me on your wedding night.
Hel-lo!!++++@++++Has the whole world gone insane?
Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?++++@++++I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!
Oh, be nice.++++@++++Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!
Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast.++++@++++But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!
Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!++++@++++Hunting, eh?
What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!++++@++++Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?++++@++++It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
Uh-oh, something's gonna die!++++@++++Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?
I know this much: I wouldn't wear that hideous hat. Here, take this one -- it was worn by Yale Summers in "Daktari."++++@++++Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!
Oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive Betsy. Right.++++@++++No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!
Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.++++@++++That is a very immature attitude, young man.
Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn. Well, Homer, you ready to call it quits?++++@++++Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --
C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man.++++@++++Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian.
...Aw, geez, Homer! Geez! You and Marge ain't cousins, are ya?++++@++++No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.
Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer.++++@++++Yep, and it's your shot, son.
What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.++++@++++C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?
Aw, criminy! Here come the waterworks.++++@++++Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer.
Dad, I'm scared.++++@++++Me too, son.
No, don't! You have to protect yourself!++++@++++Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!
Dad, are you hurt?++++@++++Just... my bones... and organs...
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.++++@++++What the -- ?
Whoa, it's Santa, all right! And he is kickin' ass!++++@++++It's a miracle!
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before.++++@++++I've been tenderized.
Stop, you idiots!++++@++++Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- "queer!" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?
Great! Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life. Now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.++++@++++Amen to that.
Ho-mer.++++@++++Oh, all those stairs...
Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey.++++@++++Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --
We're very proud of you, by the way.++++@++++And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --
But he's safely locked away!++++@++++In a medium-security prison.
For life!++++@++++Unless he gets out somehow.
Which is impossible!++++@++++Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before.
You can't ask God to kill someone!++++@++++Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
Madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers.++++@++++Lisa too?
Especially Lisa. But especially Bart. If he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, I can't be held responsible for my actions.++++@++++Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners.
Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties.++++@++++You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.
You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV.++++@++++The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort.++++@++++Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses.
Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?++++@++++Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh...
Please, please, please!++++@++++I'll have to ask her.
Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?++++@++++Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
Why you wearing it now?++++@++++Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot.
And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!++++@++++Can you see the pie stains?
Dad, help me out!++++@++++Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says.
Uh, I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us.++++@++++All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked.
Oh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like!++++@++++You've never been?
I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us "yuppies," huh, Homie?++++@++++Nah, I'm really more of a slacker.
Oooh, Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop.++++@++++Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!
Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building.++++@++++Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs.
Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call.++++@++++Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one.
And she is on DRUGS!!!++++@++++Give me the drugs, Lisa.
I'm going down to Moe's for a coupla beers.++++@++++I'll come with you.
No! No more drinking! I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.++++@++++Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?
But what's the solution? Are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? Channel Six says yes.++++@++++Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
Dateline: Springfield. With prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!++++@++++Glad you're finally back in business, Moe.
Hey, hi, can I arrest any of you people for anything?++++@++++No.
Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. And so am I.++++@++++Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!
Sounds like you have a plan.++++@++++Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...
Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup.++++@++++Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone.
Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!++++@++++Really? I heard good.
What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?++++@++++Nothin'.
I don't think it had broken axles before.++++@++++Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past.
That's funny... I used to be able to go down there.++++@++++Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
Why do you have so many bowling balls?++++@++++Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!
Beer!++++@++++I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!
You're the one the papers have been talking about. That mysterious "Beer Baron" who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol! How have you been getting away with this?++++@++++Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's.
Homer, that's very clever!++++@++++Huh?
Well, it is. I've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law...++++@++++It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!
You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron. And I'll find you.++++@++++No you won't.
Yes, I will.++++@++++Won't.
Dateline: Springfield. The elusive Beer Baron continued to thumb his nose at authorities. Swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say: "Look at me, Rex Banner. I have a new hat."++++@++++Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!
Uh, Dad...++++@++++Call me Beer Baron.
All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business.++++@++++But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
Homer! My customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! You gotta get me more beer!++++@++++Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk...
Look, find it, buy it, make it, I don't care. Just get me some booze, and fast!++++@++++"Make it," eh?
You know, they're fifty for $3000 today.++++@++++I said forty-two!
Now you're making your own alcohol? That's even more illegal than what you were doing before!++++@++++Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail.
Tubby? Oh, yes, Tubby!++++@++++Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?
One of the stills --++++@++++Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner.
Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again.++++@++++What, dear?
You've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now, while you're ahead?++++@++++Boom.
Stick 'em up.++++@++++Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible.
Yeah, never mind how I look. You gonna give me the money or not?++++@++++Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing.
Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. C'mon, give me the dough. I can throw this pretty hard.++++@++++Poor Wiggum.
Poor Wiggum.++++@++++I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?
Um, who?++++@++++The guy who took your job.
Oh, yeah... More than anything in the world!++++@++++Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?
..then, the liquor-filled bowling balls travelled through a network of underground pipes, finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy.++++@++++You forgot one thing, Wiggum.
Yeah? What's that?++++@++++I filled the balls with a funnel.
That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?++++@++++Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...
...And he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult.++++@++++Last time I help you.
On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again.++++@++++Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore.
And so, one town's brief flirtation with prohibition ended in a joyous remarriage to Lady Liquor! Congratulations, Springfield! We wish you the very best!++++@++++To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!
Three and a half. We get beat up, but we get an explanation.++++@++++Mayday! Mayday!
Oh, my goodness.++++@++++Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is "Krabappel?" I've been calling her "Crandall." Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself.
Homer, Bart's up there!++++@++++Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house.
Did you check your pocket?++++@++++It was in... It was in my pocket.
Homer, this is yours.++++@++++Yes! My precious "CarTOONS!" "Who pumped Ethyl?!"
My name is... Santa's Little Helper.++++@++++Marge, mail's here.
And for Homer --++++@++++Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
And so handsome! Bart, I just love him!++++@++++Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper.
Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes.++++@++++Wow, I gotta start going to church.
What've you got for me, boy? Hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat.++++@++++Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.
"Some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."++++@++++Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?
Oh, it's against the house rule... Oh, I guess just this once.++++@++++Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty.
Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?++++@++++Do you think he noticed?
Where's Santa's Little Helper?++++@++++Who?
Well, we wrecked the first dog. We've got to treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk.++++@++++No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms.
Hey, that is one fine-looking animal you've got there.++++@++++Wow, TV's Kent Brockman.
Ha, ha. Hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?++++@++++You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?
Time for a walk. Again? We gotta find out where he's keeping these.++++@++++I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable.
Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?++++@++++Can do.
No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.++++@++++He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
We can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I don't know where he is.++++@++++You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!
I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. I messed everything up and now I don't have any dogs at all.++++@++++There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog.
I don't want a new dog. I want Santa's Little Helper.++++@++++Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!
I love this song.++++@++++Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
I'm going to get the dog back.++++@++++The bad dog or the good dog?
The bad dog.++++@++++Oh good.
Mom, Mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!++++@++++Marge!
I could still use more paper.++++@++++Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!
Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.++++@++++Oh, okay.
Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look...++++@++++Can Lenny have it?
Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant.++++@++++Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
You found a candy bar?++++@++++Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale...
They're not going to close the plant, are they?++++@++++No, the bank put Lenny in charge.
There's got to be more trash around here somewhere...++++@++++Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!
Thanks, Dad!++++@++++You're welcome, honey.
Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns and I want your daughter to help make me rich again.++++@++++You mean Maggie?
Ah, the baby who shot me. No, I was referring to your other daughter.++++@++++Lisa! You have a guest!
Nothing evil. That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal.++++@++++See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?
Well, Lisa, as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent.++++@++++It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
And from our "It's Funny When It Happens To Them" file... Remember millionaire C. Montgomery Burns? The man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985? Well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?++++@++++Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders...
Wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking.++++@++++Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey.
Lisa, nobody likes a gloater. Right, Homie?++++@++++Uh-huh.
Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!++++@++++Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone.
Simpson, what are you doing here? Why aren't you at work?++++@++++I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.
Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.++++@++++Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed.
Homer, the Lord only asks for an hour a week.++++@++++In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God.
...and the very same goes for Ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy.++++@++++DAMMIT!!
Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes!++++@++++Who cares? This is the best part of the week!
Barney Gumbel.++++@++++It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?
The dump?++++@++++Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today.++++@++++It's your life.
It looks Japanese.++++@++++Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
I don't know... guilt?++++@++++Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called "volunteers" don't even get paid?
Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? It came from the dump.++++@++++But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!
Hai!++++@++++Akira, can you read this for me?
Yes. You have very lucky dishes, Mr. Simpson. This soap is from the sacred forest of Hokkaido. Renowned for its countless soap factories.++++@++++Hokkaido, eh?
Okay. Here you go. The phone book for Hokkaido, Japan.++++@++++Thank you. May I please use your phone?
Is it a local call?++++@++++Y-y-y-yes.
Moshi-moshi?++++@++++Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?
Hello Chief. Let's talk why not?++++@++++Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?
Oh, you like Mr. Sparkle?++++@++++Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!
Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!++++@++++Ow!
It's a videotape!++++@++++Put it in! Put it in!
Bor-ing.++++@++++That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid "logo". There's no other explanation.
Yep. There's your answer, Fish Bulb.++++@++++Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home.
We are home.++++@++++That was fast.
He... Mista Sparkaru! Mista Sparkaru!++++@++++Konichi-wa.
Play dead!++++@++++No, run around in circles!
...Baboons to the left of me, baboons to the right, the speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. A pair of the great apes rose up at me, but BIFF! BAM! I sent them flying like two hairy footballs. A third came screaming at me And that's when I got mad...++++@++++Now that's religion.
Any office supply company can have them made up for you.++++@++++Can I have this one?
Yes, sir.++++@++++Chair goes round... chair goes round.
Hey, Homer, ya busy?++++@++++Yes.
Uh, maybe we oughta say "Hi" to him.++++@++++I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.
How do you do.++++@++++Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
Oh, yeah. Carl and I each have a masters. 'Course old Homer, he didn't need a degree. He just showed up the day they opened the plant.++++@++++I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
Um... Yeah... Well, listen, I'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do.++++@++++Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.
Uh, I don't think we're being paid to sleep.++++@++++Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.
My name is Grimes, uh, Simpson. Frank Grimes. I took the trouble to learn your name. The least you can do is learn mine.++++@++++Okay, Grimy!
You're eating my special dietetic lunch.++++@++++Huh?
The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.++++@++++Check.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson.++++@++++I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?
Look at your control panel!++++@++++Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!++++@++++Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!
Who did this to my wall?++++@++++He did.
Come with me.++++@++++He likes you.
But, Sir, if I could...++++@++++Hi, Grimy, old buddy.
I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you. Stay the hell away from me! Because from now on... we're enemies!++++@++++Okay. Do I have to do anything?
Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither.++++@++++No, I won't accept that.
Okay, gimme that. Gimme it back!++++@++++Oh, what'll I do, Moe?
Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye.++++@++++Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?++++@++++No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.
Calm down, Homer. Calm down. Answer the door.++++@++++Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
Yeah. What did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important.++++@++++It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
Hi.++++@++++See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown.
Yeah, but look at the size of this place. I-I-I live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley.++++@++++Wow.
I... I'm sorry, isn't that...?++++@++++Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space.
You. Went into outer space. You.++++@++++Sure. You've never been?
No! I wouldn't Gaw, I've had to work hard every day of my life. And what do I have to show for it? This briefcase, and this haircut. And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?++++@++++What?
Everything! -- A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife, a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes, and lobsters for dinner. And do you deserve any of it? No!++++@++++What are you saying?
Homer, why aren't you at work?++++@++++The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?++++@++++Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road.
You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.++++@++++No he won't. He hates me.
He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.++++@++++Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!
Just a little more... Then he won't have any reason to resent you.++++@++++I'll do it. To professionalism!
Oh, here we go.++++@++++Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am.
I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.++++@++++Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?
Pipe down!++++@++++Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now...
I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. D'oh d'oh d'oh!++++@++++Hey, you okay, Grimy?
I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson.++++@++++You wish.
Frank Grimes, or "Grimy" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. And even though Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, I'm sure he's looking down...++++@++++Change the channel, Marge.
Well, golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't seen him, have you? Caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?++++@++++Over there.
Hey, I'm sweet. I'm sweeter than Jewish wine.++++@++++Barney, where's my car?!!
Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.++++@++++Ah, grrrreetings!
Darn tootin', ya lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son--++++@++++Call me when you get a karaoke machine.
Here he is!++++@++++I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
Ghost? What ghost?++++@++++B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!
You know Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show.++++@++++Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?
Yes! And it might look something like this...++++@++++Honey, I'm home!
In a minute, Homie. I have to get the door.++++@++++But, Marge...!
Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?++++@++++Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good.
Christian love?++++@++++No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy.
Well, if you won't think of society's ills...++++@++++I WANT CANDY!
Well, it's time to say "good night."++++@++++I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.
He's just kidding. We'd like to thank FOX, and the good people at Budget Lodge.++++@++++Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: "As you walk down the road of life..."
I know, I'll go to my room and think about what I did.++++@++++No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!
You know, you do have options. For example, there are behavior modifying drugs. How wedded are you to the Bart you know?++++@++++Not very.
Military school?! You lied to me!++++@++++Well, I'm sorry if you heard "Disneyland", but I distinctly said "military school."
Freak-outs?++++@++++If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?
Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.++++@++++They sure are.
Ouch! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.++++@++++That's not so disciplined.
They're just children, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++I guess.
Please don't make me stay, Dad! I'll do anything you say! I'll find religion! I'll be good sometimes!++++@++++Leggo my leg.
The wars of the future will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea. They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And as you go forth today, remember always, your duty is clear: to build and maintain those robots. Thank you.++++@++++Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?
Well, he's got more confidence!++++@++++Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence.
For satisfactory completion of the second grade.++++@++++Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!
What a day. / Let's get started. / Some serious drinkin'. /++++@++++'Evening, Moe.
NOOOOOOOOOO!++++@++++You got the black one.
No, the Playboy Mansion! Playboy Mansion!++++@++++Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!
All I remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. Or maybe it was a streetcorner.++++@++++So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school.
Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.++++@++++Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts.
Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York!++++@++++Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!
"Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan..."++++@++++My vehicle!
"...If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense."++++@++++Oh, I don't want to go to New York City.
Why not?++++@++++New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes.
Yeah! That's what people do in Russia!++++@++++It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.
Great! We're all going to New York!++++@++++Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!
Dad, our baby pictures were in there!++++@++++Don't you start.
I just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.++++@++++Marge, I can't feel my legs!
Homer, you're scaring the children.++++@++++Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.
The bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. We'll meet you in Central Park at five o'clock.++++@++++Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.
Fresh Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!++++@++++Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?
No pizza. Only Khlav Kalash.++++@++++Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl.
No bowl -- stick. Stick.++++@++++Geez! That's just... awful!
Mountain Dew or crab juice.++++@++++Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.
Only Khlav Kalash. Men's room in tower -- tower! Observation deck.++++@++++But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?
Uh, seriously, though -- my name is Bart Simpson. My father has a subscription. I'd like the grand tour, please.++++@++++It's gonna be dark soon. I'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
Yeah, ya jackass!++++@++++Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
What?!++++@++++The boss says you're fired.
My God, that maniac is heading straight for us! Go Secretariat! Go!++++@++++Ow!
Hey, it's Dad! Right on time!++++@++++We're getting outta here, now! Jump in, Marge! Trust me! Throw the kids! No time for the baby!
We're not jumping, Homer.++++@++++Come on! Let's go! Everyone into the car! Now!
What a magical city! Can we come back next year, Dad?++++@++++We'll see, honey.
Let's bake him a cake.++++@++++Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm...
I have no son!++++@++++Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.
Not if you called 'em "stench blossoms".++++@++++Or "crapweeds".
I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy.++++@++++Not if they were called "scumdrops".
To Capitol City.++++@++++And why are you and the old lady in the car?
We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back.++++@++++And why is Marge here?
I came up with the idea.++++@++++And why am I here?
Because the streets of Capitol City are no place for three unescorted ladies.++++@++++And why are the kids here?
Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.++++@++++And why is Grampa here?
And I'm not Seymour! My name is Armin! This is Armin's apartment! Armin's liquor! Armin's copy of "Swank"! Armin's frozen peas!++++@++++Can I see your copy of "Swank", Armin?
Now hold on. Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.++++@++++All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?
Well, I don't see any way out of this.++++@++++Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity.
But I'm a hero!++++@++++And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.
Well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.++++@++++Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
Yes, Mother.++++@++++BOY THE WAY THE BEE GEES PLAYED...
MOVIES JOHN TRAVOLTA MADE...++++@++++GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...
AND YOU KNEW WHERE YOU WERE THEN...++++@++++WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...
The Simpsons is filmed in front of a live studio audience.++++@++++Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?
Whoever you are, just pass it along, kid.++++@++++What a bad father.
But Dad, I'm supposed to practice an hour a day!++++@++++I'll practice you!
You'll practice me? What does that mean? Is it supposed to be some sort of threat?++++@++++Bart, make her stop.
Oh yeah?++++@++++Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves.
Dad, you don't understand. This saxophone is like my oldest friend. I've had it for as long as I can remember.++++@++++You don't remember how you got it?
Nuh-uh.++++@++++Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school...
Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late!++++@++++Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me...
Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it!++++@++++Lousy traumatic childhood.
Hi honey! How was your first day of school? Honey?++++@++++BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...
THOSE WERE THE DAYYYYYS.++++@++++And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school.
Very nice.++++@++++Yeah.
Homer, I can't get the baby to burp. Could you try for a while?++++@++++No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!
Let's never drink again.++++@++++And we never did.
That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks. And damn good cherry pie.++++@++++Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did.++++@++++Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!
Homer stop! Would you please look at the drawing?++++@++++Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!
I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.++++@++++Get it away!
I'll play catch with you, son.++++@++++Get the hell out.
Two apples!++++@++++Wait a minute... she's right!
That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart?++++@++++Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future.
That's right, honey. If you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do.++++@++++Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize.++++@++++Nah.
Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize for Kickboxing.++++@++++Hm.
I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality. Over seventy-five per cent of our graduates go on to first grade.++++@++++Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her.
Very good. Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in.++++@++++I'll give ya fifty bucks.
Our fee is non-negotiable.++++@++++Seventy-five.
Sorry. I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.++++@++++Excellente! Muchas gracias, SeÃ±orata!
And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now.++++@++++You do that.
Hello!++++@++++Dad, what are you doin' here?
And so, Springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava.++++@++++Ohhh. So hottt.
Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday...++++@++++Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?
I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...++++@++++Unless what?
Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner.++++@++++Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky.
I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.++++@++++Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning.
Balzac!++++@++++No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
But Balzac is the name--++++@++++Up up up up up up up. If "ifs" and "buts" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?
Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa.++++@++++All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner...
Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?++++@++++Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"
I'm Lisa!++++@++++She has a gift.
Uh... here, have a margarita.++++@++++Oooh.
That one!++++@++++Ohh! Saxomophone.
Would you like an inscription, sir?++++@++++Yeah. "To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."
Wow. So that's how Lisa got her sax.++++@++++Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier.
You know, Homer... I think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?++++@++++Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?
Don't forget the smell!++++@++++Will you get off my front lawn?
Why don't you make me?++++@++++Why -- oh, I give up.
You're a good father.++++@++++I learned from the master.
...and that's how an heroic hippo became a deputy.++++@++++Stupid hippo.
This just in: tensions continue to mount between Springfield and France over Mayor Quimby's now famous "frog's legs" joke. The French President has threatened swift and massive retaliation if he doesn't receive an immediate apology.++++@++++Stupid frog.
Homer, you know how unpredictable the French are. One minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. What if they start a war?++++@++++Relax, I built a bomb shelter.
That's not gonna protect us from anything.++++@++++Fine, then don't use it.
I won't.++++@++++Good.
I know it's good.++++@++++So do I.
I'm happy for you.++++@++++You should be.
Not everyone died in the blast, Homer. Some of us were merely horribly mutated.++++@++++You're mutants?
And now you must die.++++@++++You want me? Come and get me!!
Come on, we just wanna eat your skin!++++@++++Go to hell, cloaky!
Homie, is that you?++++@++++Marge! Kids! You're alive!
All the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.++++@++++Ohh, com'ere.
Friends with mutants, right.++++@++++Now that's the Marge I married.
Good morning, ma'am. Good afternoon, sir. It passed noon while I was speaking, so that was technically accurate.++++@++++He's crazy.
I take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter, sir.++++@++++Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents.
Sold! But I must warn you, this device carries a frighteningly high risk of catastrophic...++++@++++I said I'll take it.
Hey Dad, can I use the transporter sometime? Please, I swear I'll be careful.++++@++++Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!
Ow! Someone just punched me in the face!++++@++++It was your mother.
Oh! Ow! Uh!++++@++++Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little "kablamo" talk?
Bluggh? Blarrr! Blagh!++++@++++I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.
Homer, stop that!++++@++++So then Lenny says, "As if! Don't even go there, sister."
Good one, Dad.++++@++++Yeah, well Lenny said it.
There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?++++@++++Eh, it'll turn up somewhere.
Sucker!++++@++++Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart.
BLARRGH!++++@++++Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!
Mom, Dad, help! He's trying to kill me!++++@++++Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.
Hey! It worked!++++@++++Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with.
If they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?++++@++++That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.
Let us throw open the floor to, ah, wild accusations.++++@++++Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
As for the rest of you...++++@++++They're in my hair! They're in my hair!
Yar... and that's the story of the very first caramel cod. I mean, Halloween. And it wasn't long before this yearly custom became an annual tradition.++++@++++C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!
Dad, that's our house.++++@++++She's a witch!
Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?++++@++++I don't know.
You'll see all your favorite soccer stars like: Ariaga! Ariaga II! Bariaga! Aruglia! And Pizzoza!++++@++++Oh, I've never heard of those people.
And they'll all be signin' autographs.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Can we go, Dad? / Please Dad? / Please, please, please? / Can we go, huh, huh please? /++++@++++Yes, yes, oh God yes!
PelÃ© is king of the soccer field. To be king of your kitchen, use Crestfield wax paper.++++@++++Bo-ring!
Homer. We gotta get out of here.++++@++++Oh, but I want to do some rioting.
Jobbers cobknots ya mucker!++++@++++All done.
Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!++++@++++Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.
Looks like you called me ju-uust in time. This home isn't secure at all.++++@++++What did I tell you, Marge?
Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good but doesn't provide any real protection.++++@++++Oh, let's get that.
Well, I should hope not!++++@++++Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
And you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.++++@++++Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
But surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.++++@++++I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.
Homer, we need something to protect this family.++++@++++I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have.
Whoa, careful there, Annie Oakley.++++@++++I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.
Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit: holster...++++@++++Oh, yeah.
Bandoleer...++++@++++Baby.
Silencer...++++@++++Mmm-hmm.
Loudener...++++@++++Ahh.
Speed-cocker...++++@++++Ooo, I like the sound of that.
And this is for shooting down police helicopters.++++@++++Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun.
Sorry, the law requires a five day waiting period. We've got to run a background check.++++@++++Five days! But I'm mad now!
Yeah, well, you don't.++++@++++Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
Dad! It's three A.M.! Can't you mutter in your room?++++@++++Marge kicked me out.
All right. Go ahead.++++@++++Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children.
Well, let's see here, uh, according to your background check, you've been in a mental institution...++++@++++Yuh.
Frequent problems with alcohol...++++@++++Yeah.
You beat up President Bush.++++@++++Former President.
Relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?++++@++++I thought Smithers did it.
Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank.++++@++++Only if you clean your room.
No! No one's using this gun. The TV said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder.++++@++++TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.
Dad! The 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from Revolutionary days. It has no meaning today.++++@++++You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?
No...++++@++++All right, then.
I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons.++++@++++A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.
No, thanks!++++@++++Pull!
Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super-animals, such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel.++++@++++Learnin' somethin', Marge?
Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts.++++@++++Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair.
Oh, don't shoot. Just take the money and get out.++++@++++What? Oh Apu, I would never...
Can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad?++++@++++Sure thing, honey.
Missed one, Dad.++++@++++See you in hell, dinner plate.
Uhmm...++++@++++Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?
Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table.++++@++++You said the breakfast table.
It's the same table!++++@++++Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on.
But this is the first time since we've been married that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun.++++@++++All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.
I'm a lucky woman.++++@++++And I'm a wonderful man.
You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun!++++@++++I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?
How could you?! Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable...++++@++++But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!
Until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids.++++@++++So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns.++++@++++Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.
Homer! You use your gun as a can opener?++++@++++I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
Are you some kind of moron?++++@++++Yeah, but...
I'll also need to remove your tattoo.++++@++++I didn't get one yet.
All right. Vote Quimby.++++@++++Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?
Vote Quimby.++++@++++Sorry.
Down here, Homer.++++@++++Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!
Come down here.++++@++++O-kay!
What about the gun?++++@++++It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?
Do what he says. I'm too rich to die.++++@++++Freeze, bad guy!
Homer! You said you got rid of the gun. You lied to me! Again!++++@++++I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...
Yoink!++++@++++The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing.
Yo, give me the bullets.++++@++++Okay, don't shoot!
No, I don't think so.++++@++++I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!
Well, your cholesterol level is lethally high, Homer. But I'm more concerned about your gravy level.++++@++++Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
I'm comfortable with who I am.++++@++++You're a disgrace to this family.
Or good old-fashioned Pee Wee Football!++++@++++There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.
Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt.++++@++++Then it's settled.
The Wildcats!++++@++++Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had.
He's the only coach this team has ever had. And the season hasn't even started yet.++++@++++Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot.
You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize.++++@++++Fun, too.
Ooo, he's quite a little dancer.++++@++++Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!
Yayyy! / I'm special! / Wooo! / Etc.++++@++++Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times.
What a rip!!++++@++++Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason...
Sir, if I could just break in for a moment...++++@++++Yes, Roy.
Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax?++++@++++Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?
What?! What is it?!++++@++++Game's out there! Made you look...
Dad, that was really mean.++++@++++I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh.
Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?++++@++++No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you.
Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!++++@++++Me? But you were doing such a great job.
I don't want to make the team.++++@++++Then why are you running the obstacle course?
Are you wearing my self-defense whistle?++++@++++You never use it.
Good morning, everybody.++++@++++Wipe that smile off your face.
What did I do?++++@++++I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps.
Oh, man.++++@++++Do it.
You shouldn't pressure Bart like that.++++@++++Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it.
That's what I get for having faith in ya.++++@++++My father never believed in me.
Bart didn't get cut. What a surprise...++++@++++Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me "Coach" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!
But, Coach?++++@++++What is it, sweetie?
Yeah. / Yeah, he's right. / He's good.++++@++++Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut.
But I can't play quarterback. I don't even know how.++++@++++Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you.
Since when?++++@++++Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?
Good luck, Homer. No hard feelin's.++++@++++Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?
Yahh!++++@++++It's okay, son. You'll do better next time.
Aw, crap.++++@++++Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters.
Are you kidding? I reeked!++++@++++Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?
Dad, I've got some bad news.++++@++++Ohh, your Mother's not pregnant, is she?
No, I got hit by a couple of cars. I won't be able to play today.++++@++++Ohh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my back up plan... Nelson, how's your arm feelin'?
Great!++++@++++Good, take this note over to the referee.
Forfeit? / What? / Come on! / Oh, man.++++@++++Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!
Yeah, he does. / And how.++++@++++Don't listen to them, son. I have total faith in you.
You don't get it, do you? I don't want to be your stupid quarterback! I quit!++++@++++What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse.
May I be excused, Mom?++++@++++Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too.
Homer, please.++++@++++I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler...
He's doing what he thinks is best...++++@++++Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job.
Ahoy-hoy-hoy?++++@++++Mr. Burns, this is Homer J. Simpson, the father of the big quitter. Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big quitter, too, and I quit!
Homer, Mr. Burns can't see you winking.++++@++++So...
We drove 2000 miles for this?++++@++++We're in the championship. Way to go, team!
Aw, I don't wanna bother Mom at work.++++@++++Well, Bart, looks like it's just you and... Ohhh.
I'll scratch you. The hair. The hair. Slut. Loser. Skag. Skag. Skag.++++@++++I'm feelin' kinda low, Apu. You got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? You know, "Skittlebrau"?
Such a product does not exist, sir. I think you must have dreamed it.++++@++++Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles.
This thing only takes dollars.++++@++++Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle.
But I thought Uter took my place.++++@++++Consider him cut.
Time for one last play, coach.++++@++++Hold on, I'm workin' it out.
All right, I've got an arrest warrant here for a Nelson Muntz. Uh, which one of you little punks is Muntz?++++@++++Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?
It's okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson.++++@++++Are you sure, son?
Poor Bart... You know we had a lot of fun tonight, but there's nothing funny about... vapor lock. It's the third most common cause of car stallings. So please, take care of your car and get it checked. I'm Joe Namath. Goodnight.++++@++++Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut. Firestone, you're cut. So is Judge. Namath, you stay. All of those people are cut. Phil, Schultz and Wolf and Silverman. Goldreyer, O'Brien, Dolye, Selman. I don't know what... I don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. Pietila, Clan..., Kuwahaha... There're so many cuts here look, I'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. Oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. Ohhh, boy, you're cut. All of you. He's cut, I cut you! You're cut too, Shooshie!
Lazy bums.++++@++++Yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?
"This is just a note to say, I think about you every day. And when I get you all alone..." Well, it gets a little bit personal, here.++++@++++I understand. Yoink. Wow...
I know.++++@++++Whoa...
Oh, here's one from my mother.++++@++++Ooo, let's see what she wrote!
No, no. It is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!++++@++++Oh. Well, congratulations.
No, no, no. Don't you know what it means?++++@++++Not... really...
It all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...++++@++++O-kay, here we go...
Oh, I cannot get married. I'm just beginning to enjoy my bachelorhood. Ah, what am I going to do?!++++@++++Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.
No, no, no, no, you do not know Mother. She will never quit until I am married.++++@++++Then just tell her you're already married.
No, no. I cannot lie to my mother.++++@++++Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!
It worked! It worked! The lie has set me free!!++++@++++Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.
I am sorry, you do not have enough for both.++++@++++Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.
I'm not the type to kiss and tell, sir, but listen to this...++++@++++You dog.
Oh, no! Oh, no! What am I going to do?!++++@++++What's the big problem?
The wife that I told her I had. I do not have a wife.++++@++++Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
Oh, yes, that'll buy me some time. Homer, you've got to help me!++++@++++Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um...
What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!++++@++++Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife.
Is it me, or do your plans always involve some horrible web of lies?++++@++++It's you.
How was your day, sweetheart?++++@++++Can you feel the love?
Ohhhh. Here I am!++++@++++Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again.
Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island.++++@++++Oh, right. With the giant heads.
Baloney. You came here to put me in a home.++++@++++You're already in a home.
Abraham Simpson. Cornelius Talmadge.++++@++++Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here.
All right, folks, it's supper time.++++@++++Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!
Fully. We have to go now.++++@++++Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!
Supper time!++++@++++Oh, no you don't.
Oh, yes I do.++++@++++Eat my dust!
Wow, someone sure likes his kidney mush.++++@++++Damn right.
Another bag of chips, Mr. Talmadge?++++@++++Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?
A respirator. It breathes for him.++++@++++And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?
You mean there?++++@++++Yeah!
Well, I'm glad you were having fun, because I've had my hands full with Apu's mother.++++@++++Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?
Mother, I am so sorry. I lied to you about being married.++++@++++Lied to his mother.
Yeah, shut up.++++@++++You could fake your own death...
Oh, would you shut up.++++@++++All you need is a car bomb and...
To Marge!++++@++++Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?
Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...++++@++++Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven.
"WELL, I'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE..."++++@++++C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
Can you believe it? Tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman I am about to spend my life with. Hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?++++@++++Nah, just your screwy country.
Your old friend Apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.++++@++++Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love.
Oof, I am really doomed. Only the gods could stop this wedding now.++++@++++Gods, eh?
Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant.++++@++++Screw him.
Got you.++++@++++Come on, elephant. Put me down! Hey, everyone seems upside down.
But we didn't enter any police raffle.++++@++++That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
I don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.++++@++++Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
All right, uh, Simpson, Homer. You're next.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Ha, I hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy.++++@++++Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?
Dad? Why aren't you saying anything? Where's our motorboat?++++@++++I didn't like it. The mast had termites.
Why would a motorboat have a mast?++++@++++Because... the thingee was... shut up.
Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!++++@++++Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
What is it? / What? / That's unbelievable. / Oh, this is nice. / Wow.++++@++++Lemme through! I got here late!
Lisa's right! It's an angel!++++@++++Now that's interesting.
Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--++++@++++So long, suckers!
What are you doing with that?++++@++++I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
It's probably a million years old, Dad. I think it's as valuable as it's gonna get.++++@++++Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants.
Coming up next... an hilarious "boat giveaway" scam nets Springfield's dumbest criminals!++++@++++Sounds like goood watchin'.
Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you.++++@++++Get your own angel, ya moocher.
Sorry to trouble you, but I'm goin' in for surgery tomorrow, and I wondered if I could rub the angel with my foot for good luck. It's foot surgery.++++@++++Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!
C'mon, Homer. I just want a quick look-see. Pay ya a buck...++++@++++A buck, eh? That gives me an idea...
Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?++++@++++HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!
Dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. There's no proof of that.++++@++++No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word "angel".
What about that sign right there?++++@++++That's a typo.
Just let me take it to the museum for one day. They can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.++++@++++Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya.
You did what? / Analysis? / I don't like her.++++@++++Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
Good. Stay there.++++@++++Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!
Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!++++@++++Somebody stop her!
It's gone...++++@++++Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?
I could take up smoking.++++@++++You damn well better!
Well, it didn't ride up on no zebra.++++@++++Look! A message!
Hardly. Anyone could have written that.++++@++++Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan.
Uhm, nah.++++@++++Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too.
It's Wednesday, Homer.++++@++++Work!
Is this all we're going to do today?++++@++++Absolutely.
You know, Homer, I'm starting to realize life is short.++++@++++It is?
We have to make the most of the time we have.++++@++++We do?
Otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives.++++@++++Oh, that.
Friends of the Library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.++++@++++Pfft. Friends of the library?
Ooo... Oo! There's an Azalea festival at the public garden!++++@++++I went yesterday.
I'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!++++@++++Open a window.
I don't want a drug boat.++++@++++Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!
Sold!++++@++++Woo hoo!
You bought a car?! Without consulting me?!++++@++++I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
I found this hat!++++@++++Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.
Homer, be careful...++++@++++Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this....
Stop, Homer! Stop it! Let me out!++++@++++You're the boss.
I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.++++@++++Okay-bye-love-you.
Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer.++++@++++Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert.
What is that? A six-barrel Hollye carb?++++@++++You betcha.
Edelbrock intakes...++++@++++Nothin' but.
Meyerhof lifters...++++@++++Oh yeah.
I made that last one up.++++@++++I see.
Selling real estate could be just what I'm looking for. I'd really like to give it a try.++++@++++I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure.
They back your baaaannk!++++@++++You're all nuts.
Oh, thank you Bart, thank you Lisa, for all your help!++++@++++What about me? You didn't thank me.
You didn't do anything.++++@++++I like being thanked.
Ah! Dad! Doesn't this car have seat belts?++++@++++Seat belts?! Pfft! They kill more people than they save.
Wow! / Your own billboard! / Check it out!++++@++++Gee, that picture makes your butt look big.
Works for the Lumber King.++++@++++Lumber. We need lumber.
My high school sweetheart was killed in a drag racing accident.++++@++++Come on! It'll be fun!
That's what Debbie Sue said...++++@++++Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal.++++@++++Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother.
Well, I can too compete. And I'm going to sell a house. End of story.++++@++++Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?
Ho-ho. Okay. Baldy boy hits wire, head comes off, Li'l Bandit rolls to a gentle stop. Everybody wins.++++@++++Man, the air feels good on my neck!
Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby.++++@++++Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help.
Uh, now that you mention it, we could use...++++@++++It was just an expression.
So long! / Good-bye! / Good luck!++++@++++That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.
Gimme my car, fatty.++++@++++This is my car! And I'm not fat, it's glandular!
Whoa! This is sooo dangerous.++++@++++Yeah, you're right.
Uh, Marge? Still got that deposit check?++++@++++Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.
Still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.++++@++++Oh, you will, honey. You will.
Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly.++++@++++You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle.
Homer! Look at this mob! The good toys are probably all gone.++++@++++Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve.
Out?! But I just --++++@++++Register 9 is now closed.
I know...++++@++++Can - we - skip - church?
What? You can't rule it out.++++@++++Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us.
Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better.++++@++++Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy.
Looks like the Flanders are having a nice Christmas.++++@++++Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis.
Merry Christmas, Simpsons!++++@++++That's not as fun as it looks.
Sounds like you're having a rough Christmas, Homer. You know what I blame this on the breakdown of? Society.++++@++++Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe.
Homer, look! Your house is on TV!++++@++++You take that back, Barney!
Nah, he's right, Homer.++++@++++Stay out of this, old man.
No. My husband is... at church.++++@++++Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie.
Yeah, she's quite a gal.++++@++++You shut up.
Homer! You won't believe what's happened! It's a miracle!++++@++++Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish.
Does anyone have change for a button?++++@++++Wow, this really restores your faith in...
Hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. Well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours.++++@++++Thanks, Ted.
Hey, speak for yourself.++++@++++Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!
It is now. And because of your loss, folks, I'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks.++++@++++What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.
Will this Christmas never end?++++@++++Outta my way, snow-poke!
Slow down, Homer.++++@++++Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --
Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back!++++@++++Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?
That was close.++++@++++I knew this would happen.
Why you little...++++@++++Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!
Stop that!++++@++++I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far...
Folks, any words for the Christmas thief, if he's watching?++++@++++Yes, Kent. "Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."
Little Lisa's sweater? Little Homer's sausage?! What in the name of holy hell is going on here?++++@++++Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!
So the family never knew about any of this.++++@++++Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report.
Ha.++++@++++Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?
"...You'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. Sincerely, Moe."++++@++++Oh great, now we have to send him a card.
I know you're used to getting hate mail, but I'm not.++++@++++There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
If you're headin' for the medicine cabinet, I already been there.++++@++++What the hell's goin' on?
Yeah. Plus lots of other stuff.++++@++++Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.
Hey, that's my washcloth.++++@++++The hell it is!
Besides, it's mine. Yoink!++++@++++Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!
She's going around the other side. Now get her!++++@++++Go!
We got the popcorn! Did you get "Waiting To Exhale?"++++@++++Well, they put us on the "Waiting to Exhale Waiting List." But they said don't hold your breath.
Did you get "Emma?" Did you get "Emma?" Did ya? Did ya? Did ya? Huh?++++@++++Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No.
What did you get?++++@++++Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!
So prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of Joshua Logan's, "Paint Your Wagon!"++++@++++With blood, I bet!
THEY'RE GONNA PAINT THAT WAGON / THEY'RE GONNA PAINT IT GOOD / THEY AIN'T BRAGGIN' / THEY'RE GONNA COAT THAT WOOD.++++@++++They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?
Yeah, their guns are right there!++++@++++Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent.
He's dreamy.++++@++++Bart!
I thought it was toe-tappin' fun.++++@++++Singing is the lowest form of communication.
Homer, you sing all the time!++++@++++No I don't, I hate to rhyme.
You like musicals, don't you Dad?++++@++++NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG.
WAKE UP DAD / YOU'RE SINGING A SONG!++++@++++I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF!
IT'S A DESPERATE CRIMINAL / ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW / PLEASE SPARE MY CHILDREN!++++@++++AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.
A SINGING FAMILY! IT'S WORSE THAN I FEARED / FOR HOSTAGE PURPOSES / YOU'RE JUST TOO WEIRD. / BYE!++++@++++SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY.
I'M BACK, SO RESUME WETTING YOUR PANTS.++++@++++Okay.
BECAUSE OF YOU ALL, I GOT A TUNE IN MY HEAD / AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT, IS TO MAKE YOU ALL DEAD.++++@++++I knew I should've shut that window.
UH-OH, I'LL BE BACK WHEN I GET SOME AMMO. / BYE!++++@++++EVEN THE CRIMINALS ARE BEGINNING TO CROON.
WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY LOCAL LAWS PASSED / WITHOUT EVERYONE SINGING LIKE A BIG BROADWAY CAST.++++@++++ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS.
Done, done.++++@++++And not a moment too soon.
Come onnn. You have to go outside to do your... business.++++@++++The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how.
I'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.++++@++++Sor-reee, your majesty.
Ding ding ding ding ding...++++@++++Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man!
Looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --++++@++++It's carnival time!
Oh boy! / All right, free money! / Wow!++++@++++Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
You can't go on that. You have a heart condition.++++@++++Heart condition? Get outta here.
You had a quadruple bypass. You nearly died. Don't you remember?++++@++++Obviously, I don't. Now if you'll get out of my way...
None taken.++++@++++He's not just some "guy," Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men.
Okay, let's go, fatty.++++@++++Yes, sir!
See any pigeons yet dad?++++@++++Do do do do do...
How 'bout you, Lucky!++++@++++Who, me?
Ooh, almost... Rats, too hard... Oh, that was close... Wow, what a scam.++++@++++Sorry, son. Daddy failed.
Oh, listen pal, I gotta son of my own. Here.++++@++++A novelty comb! Kings among men...
Not so fast, pardner. You owe me some money.++++@++++Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes.
At the carnival? Cool!++++@++++Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please?
I don't know... You gonna get drunk and start a lot of trouble?++++@++++Sure, anything you want.
Hey, you lost your money fair and square. I didn't scam nobody.++++@++++Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work.
Aw, now don't worry. That's just to scare off thieves.++++@++++Hmm...
Ah, there you are. You two ready to work?++++@++++Yes, sir!
So what's our first job, huh? Test the roller coaster?++++@++++Fry up some cheese?
Ohh, this isn't fun... Maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small.++++@++++Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh!
Go on, give it a try. And remember, big smiles.++++@++++Oh. Bart?
Yeah, Dad?++++@++++Do I like chicken?
Does it matter?++++@++++I guess not.
Dad, we're saved!++++@++++Buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world.
Ya see, the trick here is, the rings won't fit over the good prizes.++++@++++Oh, we'll see about that. Gimme ten rings.
Well, we gotta git. Here's the money box. Uh, any questions?++++@++++Ah, yes. How do we handle refunds?
Good move.++++@++++Gimme ten rings.
Lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! I got rings and you want 'em! Win a genuine Ronex watch. Just like a real moogie star!++++@++++Hey, there's a sucker.
We're natural born carnies, Dad. If only we weren't tied down with a family...++++@++++Yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems.
But I got a few complaints that your game is crooked.++++@++++And how...
Gee, I'd hate to close you down. Maybe we can reach a little, ah, "understanding" here...++++@++++I understand.
Um, hey, Dad, I, I think he wants a...++++@++++Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman.
Uh, let me put it this way. I'm looking for my friend "Bill." Have you seen any "Bills" around here?++++@++++No. He's Bart.
Listen carefully and watch me wink as I speak. Okay?++++@++++Okay.
The guy I'm really looking for, wink, is Mr. "Bribe," wink, wink.++++@++++It's a ring toss game.
All right, that's it. I'm shutting this game down.++++@++++Well, ain't that somethin'.
Oh, good Lord. Our whole life was in that trailer. What are we gonna do now?++++@++++Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game?
I'm goin' for a corn dog. You want one?++++@++++Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code.
How long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?++++@++++Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye.
Ooo, what a nice surprise! This is so generous of you, Cooder.++++@++++Now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh Marge?
What's going on?++++@++++Cooder! What have you done to our house?
They're squatting in our house?++++@++++You can't do this to me. What about the Carny Code?
Well, well, look who's here. Mr. No Bribe. Sure, we'll help ya. Just sit down and wait for Detective Like-I-give-a-damn.++++@++++Thank you so much.
That Urkle's a hoot.++++@++++Listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... You better not be in my ass-groove!
Homer!!++++@++++Stupid Gravity.
No fires!++++@++++I've got it!
There must be a way to outsmart them.++++@++++Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.++++@++++One game of ring toss. If I can throw this Hula Hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. If I miss, I'll sign the deed over to you.
So we'd own the house legit?++++@++++That's right.
Oh, I can't watch.++++@++++Now!
Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone.++++@++++Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought.
Thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, Dad.++++@++++I always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school.
Have you heard of Krishna Consciousness?++++@++++This, Bart, is a crazy man.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you!++++@++++Right. That'll work.
A new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, Blisstonia.++++@++++Hmm. Makes sense.
We're having a free get-acquainted session at our resort this weekend.++++@++++How much is this free resort weekend?
It's free.++++@++++And when is this weekend?
It's this weekend.++++@++++Uh huh. And how much does it cost?
Um, it's free.++++@++++I see. And when is it?
C'mon, Dad! The team's arriving!++++@++++It's free, right?
No we don't, Mother!++++@++++Who cares what it is? The point is these are some decent, generous people that I can take advantage of.
But what if they try to talk us into something?++++@++++Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?
You bought four of them. Thank God the check bounced.++++@++++So, I beat the system.
Watch yourself, Dad. You're the highly suggestible type.++++@++++Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.
Welcome, brother!++++@++++Outta my way, jerk ass!
Hi, how are y--++++@++++Fish-ing.
It certainly is a beautiful day. We should thank the Leader.++++@++++Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?
Why don't you come chat with us about the Leader at the Welcome Center.++++@++++Will there be beer?
Beer is not allowed.++++@++++Homer no function beer well without.
Would you rather have beer or complete and utter contentment?++++@++++What kind of beer?
The Leader knows how miserable you, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie are.++++@++++Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.
Just come up and watch our orientation film. You're free to leave at anytime.++++@++++Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass.
And your stink brings tears to my eyes!++++@++++Now wait a minute, Moe --
The Leader is perfect!++++@++++Wait - I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
What are you talking about? There's nothing like that in there.++++@++++Well, you see, when I get bored, I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span.
But our point is very simple. You see when --++++@++++Ooh, look a bird.
Yeah, lose some weight! / Amen you're fat / moron-type++++@++++Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes.
You've failed at everything you've ever tried.++++@++++Oh, my mistake.
He even ate mine!++++@++++You gonna finish that, bony?
Or... NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER....++++@++++NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!
You what?!++++@++++Come again, Marge?
We what?++++@++++All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor.
I can't go along with this, Homer.++++@++++Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family.
Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?++++@++++I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl.
Oh, yes you are. I'm afraid it's our home now. This house will become the new local Welcome Center for this district.++++@++++And it didn't cost us a dime.
Homer Simpson, your family will be housed here for the first 100,000 years. Then something might open up in a double.++++@++++Hah, why even unpack?
Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio.++++@++++That's a negatory, good buddy!
Oh, Lord. Uh, try the emergency plate, Ned.++++@++++See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!
The Leader! / He's coming! / The Leader is coming! / The Leader! / etc.++++@++++Oh boy! We get to see the Leader pass by.
We toil in the fields and he rides around in a Rolls Royce?++++@++++Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are ya gonna do?
Oh, look who the new pet is!++++@++++I've never been so happy.
This is ridiculous, we're already married!++++@++++But Marge, we're not mass married.
Yaaay! Here comes the Leader!++++@++++What an honor! We've been called into the presence of --
All right, Now, what's so all-fired great about your fancy-pants Leader?++++@++++The Leader knows all and sees all.
Eww, well, that is impressive.++++@++++And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?++++@++++Beer?
Homer, you don't have to go with them!++++@++++But I want to go.
He's our husband now.++++@++++I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!
Hallelujah!++++@++++Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
Homer Simpson! Because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation!++++@++++Whoops.
Whoa, cool! God is so in-your-face.++++@++++Yeah. He's my favorite fictional character.
Oh, all right. You can stay up late tonight. But tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Aw, those poor badgers are soaked.++++@++++Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.
Oh my goodness! That was a long movie! It's time for school! Let's go! Let's go!++++@++++I can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers. I have Smallpox... Well, it wasn't wiped out in my house.
Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.++++@++++You liar. You don't have a home business. Why would you make up a lie like that?
No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet.++++@++++Internet, eh?
Yes indeedy. Makin' some good scratch, too.++++@++++Scratch, eh?
Yep.++++@++++Maude, eh?
What business enterprise?++++@++++Ever heard of a little thing called the Internet?
Internet, eh?++++@++++Oh yeah, everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. Way behind.
Is that my good butter?++++@++++Can't discuss that now, Marge. I have to write another delicious memo.
What exactly is it your company does again?++++@++++Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out.
How about CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet?++++@++++Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President.
Will you be able to provide an IP router that's compatible with my token-ring ethernet LAN configuration?++++@++++Can I have some money now?
Homer, Bill Gates is here.++++@++++Bill Gates? Billionaire computer nerd Bill Gates? Oh my God, oh my God! Get out of sight, Marge! I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!
Mr. Simpson?++++@++++You don't look so rich.
Don't let the haircut fool you. I'm exceedingly wealthy.++++@++++Get a load of the bowl job, Marge.
Your Internet ad was brought to my attention. But I can't figure out what, if anything, CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet does. So rather than risk competing with you, I've decided simply to buy you out.++++@++++This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!
Homer, quiet. You'll queer the deal.++++@++++Oh, right. I reluctantly accept your proposal.
Well, everyone always does. "Buy him out," boys!++++@++++Hey, what the hell's going on?!
What do we need church shoes for? Jesus wore sandals.++++@++++Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him.
Look, Homer. There's that bird you like to argue with.++++@++++Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge.
Hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman.++++@++++That's where you're wrong, pal!
Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh?++++@++++Why, yes. Yes I do.
Well, then you'll love our comedy festival. It's for a good cause.++++@++++A rest home for pirates?
No, Dad, it's to fight soil erosion.++++@++++Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of.
I finally got around to reading the dictionary. Turns out the zebra did it.++++@++++I don't get it.
Dad, the zebra didn't do it. It's just a word at the end of the dictionary.++++@++++I still don't get it.
It's just a joke.++++@++++Oh I get it. I get jokes.
Plus, I got this new boyfriend. And you know how it is when you're kissing a guy with a tongue stud...++++@++++Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes!
'Bout time. Gimme those reviews.++++@++++Take that, Marge!
Thank you. Thank you. And now, the all new comedy stylings of... Krrrusty the Clown...++++@++++Oooh! Oh! Krusty!
Uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on Sunday... out of paper towels... Oh! Oh! Oh! What's the deal with cardboard?...++++@++++Booo!
Me too...++++@++++I also have to go. Booo!
Four drink minimum?++++@++++I'll cover ya, honey.
So, I'm watchin' TV today...++++@++++Woo! TV! Yeah!
Yeah! / Right On, Krusty! / You Tell 'Em!++++@++++Impeach Churchill!
It's my allowance, Mother, and I'll burn it the way I want.++++@++++Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse.
Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car...++++@++++You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge.
I brought a bag of money in case he wants us to burn it again.++++@++++I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin' me nuts!
Oooo! / What did you do? /++++@++++Don't you hate pants?
Ow! Bart, that has nuts in it!++++@++++Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath.
Yeah, Mom says a lot of things.++++@++++Aw, I understand, kids. I'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man.
Actually, we can't take a bath anyway. The water heater is broken.++++@++++Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.
What on earth -- ?!++++@++++Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.++++@++++Whatever happened to your mail order bride?
Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp.++++@++++So her career got in the way.
Yeah, I don't blame her. No girl wants to end up with a Joe Puke-pail like me.++++@++++Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch.
Yeah, well, uh, how come I ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?++++@++++Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. Come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town.
Ah, I don't know, Homer. Women can smell panic. And, uh, right now, I gotta be reekin' of it.++++@++++Relax. All I smell is garlic and fish.
It's all yours.++++@++++Okay, I won't lie to you. A lot of people saw that. But you gotta keep tryin'.
No, I'm in love with you.++++@++++Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar.
I like a face with character.++++@++++Let's get out of here, Moe. This is goin' nowhere.
Who cares? You're goin' out with me. She's going out with me, cat!++++@++++Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
So, Renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to Moe. Do you mind if I ask why?++++@++++Maa-rrge...
But he's really grown on me. He's got this insecure, sweaty charm.++++@++++Oh, yeah, I got that.
Well, that's it. It's all over. Renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no Joe Pinchpenny.++++@++++Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money.
Ah, Homer, what am I gonna do? Renee's my last chance for true love.++++@++++If you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car.
Nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me.++++@++++Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy.
C'mon, Homer! I'm one of your dearest friends! When everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?++++@++++Oh, you did. But -- I still don't know... I can just imagine what Marge would say.
Homer, I insist you steal that car.++++@++++I'll do it!
Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now...++++@++++Mmmm... me.
Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you "steal" my car.++++@++++What about the cops?
That's the beauty part. Every cop in town's gonna be on the Police Department's Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I'm gonna be right there with 'em.++++@++++So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?
WHAM! The insurance company pays off five thousand clams. I keep showing Renee the sweet life.++++@++++You're a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months.
Why all the black?++++@++++Why all the pearls? Why all the hair? Why anything?
You look a little nervous, Dad.++++@++++No, you look a little nervous, Lisa.
You're up to something, aren't you?++++@++++No. I'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
Get off me, Mr. President!++++@++++That's what you get for not hailing to the Chimp.
Homer, did you really steal a car?++++@++++Whoa! Hang on a minute! The guard said I have visitors coming!
Dad, we're the visitors.++++@++++Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Great! Listen, I know it looks bad. But all I can tell you is I destroyed that car for all the right reasons.
I'd like to believe you...++++@++++That's my girl. You just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything.
Well, Dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff.++++@++++Aw, thanks, boy. I'll give you two packs for that candy bar.
Pssst. Homer. Homer. Wake up.++++@++++Moe! Oh, Moe, thank God you're here!
Yeah, congratulations, Homer. The plan worked perfectly.++++@++++But I'm in jail.
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's a kick in the pants.++++@++++Moe, you gotta get me outta here. Tell the cops I didn't steal the car. Say you lent it to me.
Yeah, I wish I could, Homer, but if I change my story, they're gonna throw me in here.++++@++++But Moe, we're best friends...
Ohh, cripes, the puppy-dog look. All right, all right. I'll use the money to bail you out.++++@++++Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!
Ten minutes till fresh air and exercise.++++@++++Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!
Hawaii, here we come! "I Nanakuli makou 'ai ana o na uluwahi Hawaii!"++++@++++Hawaii? What about Hawaii? Moe? Who's going to Hawaii? Am I going to Hawaii?
Hey! Stop saying Hawaii in there!++++@++++Let me out! I'm innocent! I changed my mind, I don't want to be in here anymore!
Would you care for some reading material?++++@++++Hmm... This could be useful...
Homer! Thank God, you gotta help me here!++++@++++Oh-ho, I'll help you. Help you die!
Oh, boy... Uh, I really wanna sleep...++++@++++I... also sleep... G'night, Mommy...
Oh, Homer, I been the world's biggest rat. Can you ever forgive me?++++@++++Ohh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe. After all, you get me drunk.
Aww! Ah, my poor bar. It's all gone.++++@++++Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer'll get you back on your feet.
Kids, from now on, I don't want you touching anything in our house. Dart!++++@++++Woo hoo!
More comin'.++++@++++Um, I'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito.
You'll have it in forty-five seconds, sir.++++@++++Oh, forget it!
To pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen.++++@++++Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men.
Old man? Old ma...++++@++++Hey, hey look, a freezer man!
Wait a minute... There is a note!++++@++++I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
Hey, Lis. Wanna join us?++++@++++Room for one more...
Yeah... Huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!++++@++++Hey, yeah.
And now a Channel 6 editorial reply...++++@++++Bo-ring!
Okay... Make-up!++++@++++Boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! Marge, we need five thousand CC's of snacks, stat!
I don't want to turn out that way!++++@++++What way, angel pie?
Lisa! Come on! Your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!++++@++++Fine, she doesn't get her skin!
I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours.++++@++++If I were her, I'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake.
I'm supposed to talk to you about Proposition 305...++++@++++Moochin' war widows...
Beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. You can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower...++++@++++That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls.
Homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!++++@++++We'll tape it!
Little girl -- likes her brain. What's your opinion?++++@++++Pff... "Simpson gene!" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it.
I run an unsuccessful shrimp company.++++@++++Oh. But... you run it, right?
Oh, yeah.++++@++++Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley.
Uh, I shoot birds at the airport.++++@++++Everybody hates birds! ...Right!
You probably should've researched this first, eh, Dad?++++@++++What about you?
My legs hurt.++++@++++Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing but a big bunch of losers. Show's over, folks. Go home.
What about our five bucks?++++@++++You get it after you leave. Now get out of here.
Wait a minute, Homer! You didn't ask everybody. What about the women?++++@++++Fine, fine. What do you do... "Dr. Simpson"?
Oh Dad, I've never been happier to be your daughter.++++@++++Oh well, thanks, honey. Remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success.
So, wait a minute. This means I'm gonna be a failure?++++@++++Yes, son. A spectacular failure.
Me. I smell a museum.++++@++++Yeah. Good things don't end with "eum." They end with "mania"... Or "teria." Will there be beer?
Welcome to the Knowledgeum! I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such automated information kiosks as "Welcome to Springfield Airport" and "Where's Nordstrom?" While you're enjoying our Hall Of Wonders, your car will unfortunately be subject to repeated break-ins...++++@++++What'd he say? What about my car?
I wanna read the giant book!++++@++++I'm gonna try the sex education computer!
Help! She's touching my special area!++++@++++Then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. But we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. Oh yeah, and my other friend was already there.
All right, all right, now. You're over-stimulated. Let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed.++++@++++Woo hoo! Beer, beer, beer!
But people will see me paired up with a doofus. You have no idea what that's like.++++@++++Uh-oh.
"This is Geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. So, here come de beep. Here come de beep."++++@++++"Do the message! Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."
Ohh, I found something all right.++++@++++"Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da." "After the beep."
But asking you was Ralph's idea.++++@++++You're the man, Ralph!
Did you just take a bite out of me?++++@++++Uh, Maybe.
Homer, wake up! It's time for our coffee break.++++@++++Yep, I earned it.
Yeah and you drooled all over it, ya--++++@++++Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big.
Uh, sir, we've found the problem. Some idiot threw this in the reactor core.++++@++++Success!
You did this? How could you be so irresponsible?++++@++++It's my first day.
Oh, really? Why did you think you could lie to me?++++@++++It's my first day.
Next, on Exploitation Theater: "Blackula," followed by "Blackenstein." And the "Blunch Black of Blotre Blame."++++@++++Ooh, funky.
But first, this word.++++@++++I've joined the naval reserve.
After basic training you'll only have to work one weekend a month. And most of that time you're drunk off your ass!++++@++++You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back.
Are you thinking of joining the Naval Reserve?++++@++++Would you be proud of me?
Eh, sort of.++++@++++Then I'll do it!
Just fill out this form and you're on your way to the Reserve.++++@++++There's a question that's crossed out.
Well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question.++++@++++Well, I think I can make it out. "Are you a homosex..."
For God's sake, don't answer that! I could go to jail!++++@++++But I'm not a h--
La la la la la la la! I am not listening! La la la la la la la la!++++@++++Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay?
Homie, I really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. What if you get called into combat?++++@++++Not to worry, honey. We live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light.
We don't have a Clapper.++++@++++Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping.
And although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, I'm in too.++++@++++Gee, thanks guys. This is just like "The Deer Hunter."
Good luck, Dad. Although I am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part.++++@++++Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat.
Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo.++++@++++No.
But Flanders got his kids torpedoes.++++@++++Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!
Tuck in that shirt -- shine those shoes, mister -- oh, for the love of --++++@++++Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat.
All right, Simpson. I don't like you and you don't like me --++++@++++I like you.
Um, all right. You like me, but I don't like you!++++@++++Maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
What are you, a comedian?++++@++++Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water.
Very nice, Simpson. But next time tie the other end to the ship!++++@++++Ulll.....
Permission granted.++++@++++Marge!
Stop laughing at me!++++@++++You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph.
I'm so proud of you, Homie.++++@++++Then I'll whomp him with my hat.
Hello everybody. Sparkle sparkle.++++@++++Bart!
Milhouse jumped off a cliff? I'm there!++++@++++Get back here, boy!
Well, I'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!++++@++++I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
Can I?++++@++++No!
Next weekend we're having our annual war games. Now Simpson, because of your many years as a nuclear technician we're putting you on a nuclear sub.++++@++++Nu-cue-lar. It's pronounced NU-cue-lar.
Be careful, Dad.++++@++++Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me.
Are you sure you'll be okay?++++@++++We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace.
Come on, Dad. Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?++++@++++Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different!
I'm a man of few words! Any questions?++++@++++Uh, is the poopdeck really what I think it is?
I like the cut of your jib.++++@++++What's a jib?
Homer! Join us.++++@++++Thank you.
Tell me, young man. What do you want out of life?++++@++++I want peas.
We all want peace. But it's always just out of reach.++++@++++Uh-huh.
So what's the best way to get peace?++++@++++With a knife.
Exactly. Not with the olive branch but the bayonet. Ah Simpson, you're like the son I never had.++++@++++And you're like the father I never visit.
I'll take care of it. Oh, what the Hell -- Simpson, while I'm gone, you're in command.++++@++++Me?
Homer, we've got an enemy sub closing in fast. What do we do?++++@++++I'unno.
Fifteen seconds to collision. We need a decision!++++@++++Hmm. What would the Captain say in my spot?
Don't fire the torpedoes.++++@++++Fire the torpedoes!
We're losing back-up power!++++@++++All right, all right, mellow out, everybody. The Captain'll know what to do.
That means you're in charge, Homer.++++@++++I am?
Those were the orders.++++@++++Very well then. I'm a Captain.
Sonar, out. Navigation, out. Radio, out.++++@++++Enough of what's out! What's in?
Ice-blended mocha drinks and David Schwimmer.++++@++++Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way.
Captain, how are we supposed to get home with no equipment?++++@++++Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two...
Aye, aye, Captain. Setting course for Rigel 7... I mean, home.++++@++++That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.
Mayday! Mayday! The engine room has sprung a leak! It's filling up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid.++++@++++You mean water?
Yeah, that's it. We've got a pinhole leak and there's no way to plug it!++++@++++I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen... We're in a tough spot and I don't know if we're gonna get out. Please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
Sparkle sparkle!++++@++++Bart!
Dad, the earring could plug the hole.++++@++++I'll plug your hole. I mean, eureka!
You saved us, Homer.++++@++++Mr. Moe, prepare to surface.
Attention, Homer Simpson! You have ten seconds to explain your actions before we open fire!++++@++++Uhhh... it's my first day!
I think you're off the hook.++++@++++Woo hoo!
A dishonorable discharge! It's the best we could've hoped for.++++@++++You can't spell "dishonorable" without "honorable."
I think you're a hero, Dad.++++@++++Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart.
Then can I get a tattoo that says, "Bite Me?" You never know when it might come in handy.++++@++++I don't think so, son.
A king cobra?++++@++++No.
Weapons-grade plutonium?++++@++++Ask your mother.
Knock-out drops?++++@++++No.
Ninja death stars?++++@++++Maybe for Christmas.
Eight-Eight-Eight...++++@++++Oh, will this horrible year never end?
That was last year's taxes! You have to pay again this year!++++@++++No, because... You see I went ahead and... Year-wise, I was counting forward from the last previous...
I put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!++++@++++I have a to do pile?
Homer, you know we don't have...++++@++++Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not illegal. Okay, I need some deductions! Deductions! Ah! Business gifts!
Homer, I painted that for you.++++@++++Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, Lisa's a clergyman, Maggie is seven people and Bart was wounded in Vietnam...
What about you, Homer?++++@++++Well...
Homer Simpson? United States Government.++++@++++Help! Somebody!
Mr. Simpson, this government computer can process over nine tax returns per day. Did you really think you could fool it?++++@++++No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy told me to do it.
You're looking at five years, minimum.++++@++++No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee in a cup and throw it on ya. I saw it in a movie!
You won't be seeing any prison movies where you're going... Prison!++++@++++No, please, I'll do anything!
Anything? Well, that's a start. Agent Johnson, FBI.++++@++++I'm very happy to meet you.
From now on you're gonna work for us.++++@++++Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I got a little tax problem.
They want you to spy on your friends?++++@++++Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice.
The government has no right to use you this way.++++@++++Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president.
There you go, Ratboy.++++@++++Does this make me look fat?
No, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression.++++@++++But not fat.
Oh, God!++++@++++How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?
You sayin' you want to commit a crime, Homer?++++@++++Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
Or that telemarketing scam you pulled?++++@++++Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.
Oh, you, you mean like the time Barney beat up George Bush.++++@++++Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.
Hey, how did they finger Charlie? Somebody musta ratted him out.++++@++++Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission.
My superiors were pleased with your work. You have a flair for treachery.++++@++++Well, I'm just glad it's all over.
Ohh, you're not through, Simpson. We have a high-risk assignment for you.++++@++++Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too.
Let's take a walk.++++@++++Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.
In 1945, the people of Europe struggled to rebuild following the war.++++@++++Losers...
To make good on this drunken boast, Truman authorized the one-time printing of the largest denomination currency ever: a trillion-dollar bill.++++@++++Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!
Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around.++++@++++But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him.
Sometimes I don't know why I bother.++++@++++I'm in.
Now what, Smithers? I... You're not Smithers.++++@++++Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee.
Hmm... A pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...++++@++++Uhh, I don't know what to tell you.
It'll, uh, be a few minutes. So, what brings you to my home?++++@++++Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside...
Ya! Ha!++++@++++Still cold.
Hmm. Well, let me get you a towel.++++@++++Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
What is this? What are you doing?++++@++++Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...
You're from Collier's magazine, aren't you? Are you going to put me in Star Snoop?++++@++++Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.
Well, of course, I didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to Spring Byington, do you?++++@++++No you don't. Heh, heh.
Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in.++++@++++Ewww!
That intrepid lad is my great grandfather! Franklin Jefferson Burns. Tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the Fenway Flounder.++++@++++Is that a fish?
It was.++++@++++Hey, that guy looks like you.
Let's move.++++@++++Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
Well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? I keep the real bill right here.++++@++++Wowww, that must be worth a fortune.
I'm not the thief, the government is. Every year you make hard-working Joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? Aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier...++++@++++Hey, he's right...
Ohh, you can silence me, but you can't silence Collier's magazine! Tell the people! Don't let the government push you around! You have a choice! Fight back!++++@++++I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
Faster, Simpson! Those jack-booted G-men won't be far behind.++++@++++We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.
That really was more of a burgundy...++++@++++Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways.
Capital idea! Let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. We'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of Uncle Sam.++++@++++But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?
Attention fugitives. You are leaving U.S. jurisdiction. Turn back immediately or we will be unable to prosecute you.++++@++++We'd better do what he says.
No, wait! We're now over international waters.++++@++++Woo hoo! We can gamble!
Any of these islands would make a fine new country.++++@++++I call President!
Es carne de burro.++++@++++Nice to meet you.
So, you say Batista's gone? Did you know that?++++@++++I had no idea.
Please, we are all amigos here.++++@++++Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba.
Well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then I'm guilty. And if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist Cuba, then I'm guilty of that, too. And if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, I'll soon be guilty of that!++++@++++God bless America!
Do not be alarmed. That is just my helper monkey, sir. I got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead.++++@++++Helper monkey, eh?
Ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir.++++@++++Do they do any other tricks?
Ahh, may I inquire as to how you are "differently abled"?++++@++++Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy.
Uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled.++++@++++Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back.
Oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life.++++@++++Mind if I take him for a ride?
Monkey! There's a monkey in the house!++++@++++Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch.
Why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?++++@++++This "filthy monkey" made the orange juice you're drinking.
And now... "Kids News."++++@++++Marge! The kids are on!
Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.++++@++++Honey, he's clearly marked his territory.
You already have a monkey.++++@++++Can he get a duck?
Hmm. It really makes you think.++++@++++And so on.
I want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.++++@++++No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance.
Come on, Mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money.++++@++++Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day.
I'm Sir Loves-a-Lot, the bear who loves to love!++++@++++They didn't have Lord Huggington?
It's the same basic bear, Homey.++++@++++I guess.
Kiss it and make it boogie!++++@++++Kiss it.
Uh, maybe later.++++@++++Oh-ho yeahhh...
Uh, what a terrible waste!++++@++++Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.
Yep, that's the rule. He who tops it off, drops it off.++++@++++Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.
I heard that! You know the rule.++++@++++Ooh, but I can rebuild!
And the school nurse says Bart has the plague.++++@++++You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!
What did you call us?++++@++++I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff.
Didn't you learn anything from Love Day?++++@++++That was yesterday, moron!
Oh lord! Now what are we going to do? Just let the trash pile up?++++@++++Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men.
Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?++++@++++I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.
See you in hell, brussel sprouts.++++@++++No room for you, Jell-O.
Oooooh!++++@++++Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.
Uh, listen Homer, ah, hate to be a fussy Freddy and all, but Maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors...++++@++++Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.
Go! Go! Go!++++@++++So-ho, the rats seem happy.
Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again.++++@++++That's not the way she tells it.
Yeah Dad, you're always telling me and Bart to apologize.++++@++++Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack.
I think you're startin' to crack.++++@++++Apologize for that remark.
No way.++++@++++Attaboy!
Oh Homer, you didn't beat City Hall! They picked up our trash because I wrote a letter of apology to the Sanitation Commissioner and signed your name. Period.++++@++++You signed my name? I feel so violated.
You've signed my name lots of times.++++@++++But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?
Here's your apology back, Mr. Simpson, and I'm sorry we couldn't work this out.++++@++++Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp.
I'm not tryin' to scare you. I'm just tryin' to get my work done, here.++++@++++Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras.
What cameras? Why are you still here?++++@++++I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages.
Hey, stop that!++++@++++You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!
Leave the bird alone!++++@++++Never!
Look Simpson, I've been elected by the voters of this city sixteen years in a row, so they must think I'm doing a damn good job.++++@++++You want to know what I think?
No! Nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent!++++@++++Well, we'll see about that.
Hey, everybody, vote for my Dad, Homer Simpson. If you don't he'll beat us.++++@++++Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating.
So, Homer, if we vote for you, whaddaya gonna do different?++++@++++What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me.
Yea, I know. It's a peace of mind issue you know?++++@++++These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Can I help you?++++@++++Potato man.
Okay, camera two... Uh, excuse me, this is a restricted area.++++@++++Take a hike, Kojak.
What the bloody hell?++++@++++Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911...
Why should they vote for you?++++@++++That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?
Ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there.++++@++++Can't someone else do it?
Can't someone else do it? That's perfect!++++@++++It is?
Yeah. Now get out there and spread that message to the people!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Whoa, whoa, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.++++@++++Can't someone else do it?
I would deem it excellent.++++@++++Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?
Oh man, you got that right. / Yeah. / I guess so. / It's so annoying in the morning/ Yes. / Uh-huh.++++@++++Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
I'll say.++++@++++Well then...
Hey, yeah!++++@++++And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
Yeah! / Someone else! / Someone else! / Yeah!++++@++++Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico.
Sorry I'm late, everyone. Somebody tampered with my brakes.++++@++++Well, then you shoulda been early.
Oh, c'mon, people. This man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. That's impossible!++++@++++Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables...
I can't believe what I'm hearing!++++@++++Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops.
Pops? I'm only two years older than you!++++@++++Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?
What button? What the hell are you talkin' about?!++++@++++What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?
All right, fine. If you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. But if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Aren't you gonna buy it, Dad?++++@++++Fifty cents? Not likely.
If I hadn't already packed my letter opener, I'd give you such a stabbing...++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?
Friendship? You told people I lure children into my gingerbread house.++++@++++Yeah, that was just a lie.
Simpson, the American people have never tolerated incompetence in their public officials. You are going to crash and burn, my fat-headed friend.++++@++++See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle.
Wow, Dad, you're really working hard.++++@++++Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises.
I'm really proud of you, Homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?++++@++++Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can.
Simpson, you idiot, you spent your entire year's budget in a month. Your department's broke.++++@++++Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution.
How could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?++++@++++They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp!
You know Dad, there's a lesson in all this. Many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just...++++@++++Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!
My men ain't workin' another minute till we get paid.++++@++++Will cash be okay?
I'll have to say drugs, too.++++@++++Close, but you're way off.
Good God, Homer! You're turning our wonderful little town into America's trash-hole.++++@++++Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
But Dad, you can't cram garbage under Springfield forever.++++@++++Sure I can, Honey-kitten.
What the hell is that?++++@++++Uh, nothin'.
And all those opposed to horse-whipping Homer Simpson?++++@++++Nay!
I can't believe it's come to this.++++@++++Come to what?
Moving the whole town five miles down the road! It's crazy!++++@++++Yeah, it's somethin', all right.
So we transplant the town. We're just gonna trash the new Springfield, too.++++@++++Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.
Wowwww! McBain has really buffed up. You could grate cheese on those abs.++++@++++Yeah, but can he do this?
Anyway, it's time for the church picnic.++++@++++What? They had a picnic last week.
No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church.++++@++++If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin.
Aw nuts!++++@++++Ooo, still plenty of parking.
Nice to see you, Homer.++++@++++Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food.
Oh, you'd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. C'mon, Dad. We're playing Capture the Flag!++++@++++Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?
But Rod picked his Dad. It's a matter of family honor.++++@++++Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?
Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good...++++@++++I agree. Let's surrender.
No, wait. I have a plan. But I'll need your underpants.++++@++++Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair.
Get him!++++@++++Stupid kids...
Tag tag tag tag tag!++++@++++Time out... t... time out...
Oh, I don't think he can get up. Let's egg him!++++@++++Oh, stop it!
Me? I'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.++++@++++Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape.
Whatever you say, sweetie.++++@++++No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time.
So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?++++@++++Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?
Oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free.++++@++++Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy.
Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce.++++@++++Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow.
Excuse me. You're doing this station all backwards. Let me show you how to do it like a man.++++@++++Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--
Push! Harder! Go past the max! Reach over the top! Master your ass!++++@++++Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word "dumbbell" meant. This place is great.
And your shirt!++++@++++I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!
Oh my goodness gracious!++++@++++Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--
I've got some!++++@++++No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps.
Whoaa...++++@++++Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?
My casserole is not filth. Eat it.++++@++++Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all.
Now that's just non--++++@++++You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action.
Homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. Food. I mean, food.++++@++++Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar.
You know Rainier Wolfcastle?++++@++++Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone.
He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day.++++@++++Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on.
Hm. Congratulations, sir.++++@++++Huh?
You're gonna be the first man to climb the Murderhorn.++++@++++I am?
Son! Don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there! Just like I did!++++@++++You? Did?
I fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'Course folks were tougher in those days. I was jitterbuggin' that very night. But that skunk McAllister was never seen again.++++@++++If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!
Homer, you're the world's greatest hero. Do you owe it all to Power Sauce?++++@++++That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity.
Dad, wait. You're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?++++@++++Well, yeah...
Shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?++++@++++Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced.
Frankly we don't care.++++@++++So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own.
Then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over?++++@++++Shut up. You are so fired.
Are you crazy? You'll never make it.++++@++++The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.
Homer, listen to me! Turn back now!++++@++++Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.
Oh, Homie! You're alive!++++@++++Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again.
Didja make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Didja?++++@++++Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?
All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off.++++@++++Aw, dammit!
Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest Dad ever.++++@++++Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile.
'Mornin' boys. Can't stop to chat. Time is money.++++@++++'Mornin', Barney.
Hey Dad, wake up.++++@++++Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer.
It's Lisa. I just called to tell you how much I love you and can I take the bus to the museum?++++@++++Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?
Ahm... I wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room.++++@++++Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision...
Well... if it would put your mind at ease, I could take a limousine. Although that would cost two hundred dollars...++++@++++Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?
Hmm. I guess I could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea.++++@++++Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus.
Oh, what, this thing? I got it down at the museum. It's what the ancient Egyptians call a "souvenir."++++@++++My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus.
Alone?++++@++++MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire.
That never, uhh, happened, did it, Homer?++++@++++Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter.
But--++++@++++Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot.
Shouldn't you be at work right now?++++@++++Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir.
Well then, get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.++++@++++Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?
Excuse me, ma'am? Uh, hello? Somebody? Anybody?++++@++++Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!
Dad, grab onto it!++++@++++Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!
Are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.++++@++++Nah, I'll just walk it off.
I should have known I wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again!++++@++++Don't ever say that.
Dad! You're headed for the river again!++++@++++Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?
Dad, are you all right?++++@++++I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!
See the Isis exhibit. But the museum's closed.++++@++++Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am.
Dad, I'm kind of scared.++++@++++Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
Okay... Here goes.++++@++++Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.
Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?++++@++++Uh... not this exquisite.
Archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means.++++@++++Well, Daddy will figure it out.
Oh! We can't touch it, Dad. It's behind a velvet rope! A velvet rope.++++@++++Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further.
It's a music box! Dad, we uncovered the secret!++++@++++Oh, so now it's we, eh.
Thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, Dad.++++@++++Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us.
It's kind of humbling, isn't it? The music we just heard might never be heard again.++++@++++Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it.
Dad, that's the Old Spice song.++++@++++It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...
Do do do do-do / Do do do do-do / Do do do do do do do do.++++@++++Run!
And look as handsome as the day we were married.++++@++++Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge.
You mean Frank Grimes?++++@++++Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?
Ohhh, look, Homie. Our wedding cake.++++@++++You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? Why was I not informed?
Look at this little plastic couple. Mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future...++++@++++Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? Wee little parties?
I'm going to bed.++++@++++Gotcha!
Good night, Homie.++++@++++You know, um, it is a special occasion...
Yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the Casbah.++++@++++Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.
Oh. Oh, did you want me to...?++++@++++Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh...
No, no, no, I have my part in this, too, um...++++@++++I know, but let me get you started first.
Homie, you got your, your elbow in...++++@++++Oh, sorry.
Mmm.++++@++++Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Do you want me to?++++@++++No, no. Don't do that.
Well, we used to...++++@++++I know, but I don't like it.
Ooh! Who's a good boy?++++@++++He's the best boy!
Oh yes he is! Yes he is!++++@++++Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?
Oh, yeah. He's really special.++++@++++I love that dog.
I love him, too. G'night.++++@++++G'night.
Homer, don't look.++++@++++What?
Someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. We can get a new one.++++@++++Okay.
When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our Saturdays? Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?++++@++++Eh, I never thought I'd live this long.
Ooh. There's the turn!++++@++++I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'.
Safe at last.++++@++++Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.
Huh. Well, maybe they're in the media room.++++@++++That was close!
Ohhh. My hero.++++@++++At your service, milady.
Uh, Captain? Captain? I-I know we usually bury the treasure... but what if this time we use it to buy things? You know, uh, things we like.++++@++++No, no, honey. Maybe this will help.
He put new electrical tape on the cushions.++++@++++Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast.
Oh, isn't it romantic? Doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see.++++@++++If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it.
Should we get started?++++@++++Um, no time like the present.
Hm, something's not right. Does this bed feel lumpy to you?++++@++++Well, yeah, kinda...
Oh, my heart's beating like crazy.++++@++++Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.
Y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on.++++@++++There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea.
Shh! They'll hear us.++++@++++They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
Exactly. Now there's nothing left out there but treasure.++++@++++Hello, everybody.
Hey, you're back. Did you rock the Casbah?++++@++++Bart! Yes.
It's okay when you're in love. And married. To the sweetest guy in the world.++++@++++Awww... Eskimo kiss!
You don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?++++@++++I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
Oh, this is so naughty. Coming back to our old love nest...++++@++++It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.
Oh, we drank so much that night.++++@++++Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit.
Heh, heh. Yeah.++++@++++Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer.
We're trapped!++++@++++Oh, why can't they just play through?
Who cares what it is? Let's monoxide it.++++@++++Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?
We've gotta get home before someone sees us.++++@++++Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--
All right, men, those nudies are here somewhere. Fan out.++++@++++Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should give ourselves up.
But think of the scandal.++++@++++Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do.
Clothes! We're saved!++++@++++These have pleats...
You mean this thing?++++@++++No, that was not the thing.
Hang on, Homie. I'm gonna try to set her down.++++@++++Thank you...
Dear Lord, look at that blimp. He's hanging from a balloon.++++@++++Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... Baby doll...?
Kids, I want to explain about the stadium. Y'see, sometimes Moms and Dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other.++++@++++Dads especially!
So they need to explore new ways to express their love.++++@++++Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
All those eyes, just leering and leering at us.++++@++++Who's in the mood for miniature golf?
Look, Dad, they've got every kind of paper! Looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!++++@++++Can't you just write on your arm like I do?
Yes, sir! One Kwik-E-Dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of "Success" magazine.++++@++++Hey, this hot dog tastes different.
Yes, I just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.++++@++++Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus.
I'm so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant.++++@++++People buy grease?
Oh yes. They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food...++++@++++Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!
Uh, Dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.++++@++++Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
Homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.++++@++++Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence.
With cans of grease?++++@++++No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!
Come on, Bart. The bus is here.++++@++++Where do you think you're goin'?
It's the first day of school.++++@++++Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.
Four pounds of grease... that comes tooo... sixty-three cents.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.++++@++++Yeah, but your Mom paid for that.
But doesn't she get her money from you?++++@++++And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?
Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss.++++@++++Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives.
They only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... Oh, and get this, Mom, she drinks iced tea.++++@++++Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way.
But, Dad...++++@++++Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?
When you want grease, go to the source: good old Krusty Burger.++++@++++Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
I was thinking more of the deep fryer.++++@++++All right. We'll try it your way.
Can I help you, sir?++++@++++My God, you're greasy.
Mom's gonna kill you.++++@++++If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys.
We run the grease racket in this town.++++@++++Hey, that's my shovel.
My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?++++@++++Oh, what's the point?
You're taking me! You got that?! And it's gonna be a magical evening!++++@++++Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything.
Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?++++@++++Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge.
Dad, he's not stupid.++++@++++All right, screw it. Let's roll.
Don't worry. This is the score we've been dreamin' about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.++++@++++Okay, turn on the suction.
Where's the hose?++++@++++Bringin' up the rear.
Are you as excited as I am?++++@++++Oh, yeah.
Eek! -- I mean, ach! -- I mean, what are you doing here?++++@++++Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland.
Saints be praised! I'm from Scotland! Where do ye hail from?++++@++++Uhh... North... Kilt... town?
No foolin'?! I'm from North Kilt-town! Do you know Angus MacCloud?++++@++++Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!
Not so fast, boy-o. Well, if it was up to me, I'd let ya go. But the lads have a temper... and they've been drinkin' all day.++++@++++Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!
Uh... guys? Guys? The hose.++++@++++Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults.
Hey, Luigi bringa you kids free pizza. Why you have to maka da fun, huh?++++@++++That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!
Doctors say the life expectancy of the average man is now seventy-six point two years.++++@++++Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!
Sir, do you need a tow truck?++++@++++What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a...
Oh, honey, don't eat that. Wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?++++@++++No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral.
Indubitably, old chum.++++@++++Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny.
Okay, but you've accomplished a lot. You've made me very happy.++++@++++Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that.
Hi, Dad. How was work?++++@++++Cold.
Surprise!++++@++++Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later.
The kids and I want to show you all the great things you've done.++++@++++Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong.
There you are in outer space. That's pretty impressive.++++@++++All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.
Remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?++++@++++No.
Well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children.++++@++++Hike.
Your family has asked me to take time out from my busy schedule to invite you to a very speciallll...++++@++++Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?
That, too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car.++++@++++No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar.
It's true. I read it on a place mat at a restaurant.++++@++++Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think.
Top of the world, ma!++++@++++Cut it out, boy!
Dad? What are you doin' here?++++@++++Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.
That's great, Dad.++++@++++And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers.
They're all about smugglers.++++@++++No, not this one. "The Smugglers of Pirate Cove." It's about pirates.
Excuse me, are you a student at this school?++++@++++I think it's pretty obvious that I am.
That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant.++++@++++Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.
Huh? Oh... uh... oh, nuts. I forgot. All I can think of now is Edison. I can't even remember where I work.++++@++++Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and...
Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.++++@++++That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!
All right, already! Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison!++++@++++Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter.
Well, you're not Thomas Edison.++++@++++Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison!
Do us a favor. Invent yourself some underpants.++++@++++Well, I quit my job just like you said to.
I didn't tell you to quit your job.++++@++++Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house.
I'll get you, you fat lunatic!++++@++++At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him.
Something electrical might be good.++++@++++What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do.
Oh?++++@++++You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables.
Homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer.++++@++++My files!
You've started smoking, Dad?++++@++++Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.
Yeah. He invented stuff, too.++++@++++Shutup.
Butt.++++@++++Okay.
Booger.++++@++++Uh-huh.
Homer! You can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.++++@++++I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.
Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are.++++@++++Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community.
And these should give you the grounding you'll need in thermodynamics, hyper-mathematics, and of course microcalifragilistics.++++@++++Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me.
Well, all you have to do is think of things that people need, but which don't exist yet.++++@++++You mean like an electric blanketmobile?
Possibleh. Or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it, like--++++@++++Hamburger earmuffs!
Uh, well, well... I suppose that... would... qualify, uh...++++@++++Thanks, sucker!
I will buy ten of those right now.++++@++++Now, here's my "Everything's Okay" Alarm.
Turn it off, Homer.++++@++++It can't be turned off.
Homer, you've got it set on "Whore."++++@++++Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed.
Dad, women won't like being shot in the face.++++@++++Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.
You expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?++++@++++Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one.
No, Bart. Homer... all these inventions, they're...++++@++++Yes?
They're not very...++++@++++Yes? Yes? Yes?
They're terrible.++++@++++What?
I'm not saying you're a bad inventor. I'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. Or accept them as gifts.++++@++++But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.
Do you mind?++++@++++All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father.
Homer! / Dad! / Look out!++++@++++Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff.
It could save lives!++++@++++Really? You think it's a good idea?
Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap.++++@++++I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster.
If Edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?++++@++++It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.
But I thought you loved Edison.++++@++++Aw, to hell with him!
Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!++++@++++Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.
Man, I can't wait to smash that chair.++++@++++Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm.
Ohh! / Well, now that I'd like to see. / Yes.++++@++++Now let's take care of business.
Your electric hammer, maestro?++++@++++Invent your way out of this, Edison.
You mean the wild mood swings?++++@++++No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.
Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad.++++@++++Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.
...Authorities say the phony Pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth. In other news, Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of all time...is apparently still inventing, despite the notable handicap of being dead.++++@++++That's my Tommy.
I gotta admit, Homer. You're taking this pretty well.++++@++++Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.
That's me!++++@++++Well, that's it.
One stinkin' letter? Why'd you make us gather 'round like that?++++@++++I needed my power fix.
Yeah, Lis. She is a smart, sophisticated woman. Now let's hear more about that big, big reward.++++@++++Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward.
Cram it, ma'am.++++@++++Stand back and watch the pro.
Uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?++++@++++Nah. They mess up my hair.
While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?++++@++++All right.
That's your underwear.++++@++++Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?
He's up in his room. Bart?++++@++++It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse.++++@++++MILHOUSE!
I think he's at Nelson's!++++@++++WHO'S NELSON?
Oh, yes. And punish Lisa for lying to us.++++@++++All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer.
Better.++++@++++And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart.
Mmm. What do you think he's doing up there?++++@++++I'unno. Drug lab?
Drug lab?!++++@++++Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing.
That never happened, Dad.++++@++++Sure it didn't.
Hmm... it's starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.++++@++++Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?
Actually, it took fifty-three hours.++++@++++Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?
I see a neck!++++@++++I see a horn!
Man, those are some funky-lookin' birds.++++@++++Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.
You're a lizard.++++@++++Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.
Let us roll.++++@++++Stupid cards.
Dibs on the liver!++++@++++Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!
This is genuine human hair.++++@++++This is legal, right?
Ooooh-woo! Wow. If your fly weren't open, you'd look just like Roger Moore.++++@++++Later, chickie-pie.
Ooh. Ooo-la-la Simp-son. Huh. What can I do for you and your new do?++++@++++You sent me to the chair.
Snake? But you're dead.++++@++++I know you are, but what am I?
... And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.++++@++++Oh, my God!
Ah, morning, Homer. Ah, you're looking unusually focused this morning.++++@++++Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you.
Don't you get it? He swore he'd kill me too. I'm next!++++@++++Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.
Nooo!++++@++++Come here, you little--
My school picture!!++++@++++Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!
You've got to fight the hair, Dad!++++@++++But I look so youthful and hunky.
Get off of me.++++@++++I'll show you, hair!
Ow! That's my face, you idiot!++++@++++Idiot?! Why you... little...
Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of Moe Szyslak and Apu Nahasa -- pasa -- Uh, just Moe, just Moe.++++@++++It wasn't me, it was the hair!
Oh, Homer, you're not going as a hobo again?++++@++++Going where?
Well, we're leaving. And remember, no Itchy and Scratchy. I better take these batteries just to be sure.++++@++++Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...
Dad, you gotta get us out of here! Use the remote!++++@++++Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... "pause," "three," no "fa-fa"...
She's teething. Look... her very first baby tooth.++++@++++Ohh... Ahh...
Oh, geez!++++@++++I just lost my appetite.
I hear all.++++@++++Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs!
Homer, do something! The ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!++++@++++All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...
We'll return with "How Dracula Got His Groove Back."++++@++++Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons.
Oh, Lord. I was hoping this day would never come.++++@++++Huh? What are you talking about?
And now she must return home to Rigel 7, where she will be guaranteed a lucrative civil service job for life.++++@++++Well, we can't compete with that, but--
Homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?++++@++++It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired.
Well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us.++++@++++One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !
Suckers.++++@++++C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home.
Dad! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!++++@++++Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on.
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you promised to take us to the lake.++++@++++I promise you kids lots of things. That's what makes me such a good father.
Actually, keeping promises would make you a good father.++++@++++No, that would make me a great father.
Yes, we'll go to the darn lake! Now go back to bed. It's four A.M.!++++@++++Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to...
Homer, your spine!++++@++++Screw this. Hang on, everyone. We're takin' the ol' Simpson shortcut.
Whooa!++++@++++So long, suckers!
Stop calling everyone suckers!++++@++++Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate.
Tree!++++@++++I see it.
This is such a secluded area. I wonder who lives in that house?++++@++++Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.
So, I suppose that's a hillbilly Jacuzzi?++++@++++Lower! Lower!
Hey, here come the Simpsons. N-Now be careful, Homer. There's a fella in the sand right in front of ya...++++@++++Okay, remember where we parked.
There you go. And I assume you've read the boat safety manual.++++@++++Oh yeah, couldn't put it down.
Uh sir, you can't operate a boat under the influence of alcohol.++++@++++Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me.
Check.++++@++++Tow rope?
Secure.++++@++++Skier?
Ready.++++@++++Here we go!
She's down.++++@++++Ooh, look at it go.
I don't know... I think Dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.++++@++++Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!
Step on it, Mom. Dad's signaling that he wants to go higher.++++@++++Higher!
It won't go any --++++@++++Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at God's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.
There goes my turn.++++@++++Oh, this is not good.
What the hell?!++++@++++Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger
It's Basinger.++++@++++Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger.
Thanks. Listen, you think you could slide over a little?++++@++++Well, I am a married man...
I'm Alec Baldwin. Could you get off me?++++@++++So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital, Mr. Simpson? You had an awful lot of glass in you.++++@++++Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?
Hm, Sometimes we need to get away from Hollywood. L.A. is just so phony.++++@++++Oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... Bethesda?
What we really like here is the privacy. Most people don't even know where Springfield is.++++@++++Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure.
I'm gonna eat it later.++++@++++A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses.
No more muffins.++++@++++Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken.
Yeah, I'm not sure we need an assistant, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Please, Homer. C'mon, if you let me hang around a while, I can do all kinds of stuff for ya.
I suppose we could give it a try.++++@++++Yeah, you owe me that much.
Will you promise to keep our secret?++++@++++Absolutely. If you promise to keep mine.
Okay, what is it?++++@++++I can't read.
But you just read that card from the Gersh Agency.++++@++++I recognized the logo.
We've been looking all over for you, Dad. Where did you land?++++@++++Nowhere famous.
Where'd you get that muffin?++++@++++Gersh Agency.
Mister Simpson, these exotic items are suspiciously different from your usual order of beer and pork. What gives?++++@++++Nothing, nothing. I'm just broadening my horizons. Uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?
When you win one, you can take care of it however you want.++++@++++Ooo, me-ow.
Hi, I'm Ron Howard.++++@++++Ron Howard?!
Yeah, I'm lookin' for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.++++@++++Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?!
Oh, that's just Homer. He's a new friend of ours.++++@++++Really? You giant stars consider me a friend? Well, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somebody. Ronny, are you also my close friend?
Do I smell vodka... and wheat grass?++++@++++It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?
Ooh, I'll have one of those, too. Hey, can I crash here tonight?++++@++++Sure. We'll all stay.
A cell phone? Last Thursday's "Variety"?++++@++++I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.
Oh, they don't come much bigger than that.++++@++++Kent Brockman. Please.
But that's not what P.E.T.A. stands--++++@++++Imagine Films.
Homer, I'm feeling some sharp pains in my neck.++++@++++That's right, force it. Whip that neck.
Um, does anybody know where this came from?++++@++++Oh, there's that movie script I wrote. Where did you find it?
On my pillow.++++@++++The important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. Either one of you. It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. Ron Howard's attached to direct.
No, I didn't!++++@++++Did too!
I did not!++++@++++You lie!
Yeah, Homer, um, most movie scripts are 120 pages. This is only seventeen. Annnd several of the pages are just drawings of the time machine.++++@++++So you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
I'm sorry, Homer.++++@++++Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie.
Oh, what? I suppose you've seen a bigger star?++++@++++I might have.
Come on, make with a name.++++@++++Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't.
Tell the people, Homer. They have a right to know about the celebrity summer house.++++@++++Who the hell are you?
What do you care? I'm telling you what you want to hear.++++@++++All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did.
Yess! In your freckled face, Howard!++++@++++Unbelievable?
My God. The lemonade. Look at the lemonade!++++@++++Uh-oh.
Somebody must have told them we live here.++++@++++I'm looking at you, Horshak.
Homer, how could you?++++@++++Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!
Homer, you betrayed our confidence. I just don't think we can be friends anymore.++++@++++But where will I bask?
Anywhere but here.++++@++++Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here.
Homer, you haven't touched your food.++++@++++When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?
Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?++++@++++Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day.
I washed the dog today.++++@++++Was it the dog from the Beethoven movies?
Of course not.++++@++++Our dog isn't famous. And you kids aren't exactly John and Joan Cusack. And you. You couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. I'm about ready to ankle this family.
Ankle? "Foccacia"? What are you talking about?++++@++++See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.
Don't blame us, Dad. The celebrities are the ones who canned you.++++@++++Hmmm... She may not be famous, but she's right. Those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. I did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... And I've still got a car full of their crap. Crap, eh...?
I never get tired of that.++++@++++Attention starstruck fools!
Hey, it's Alec Baldwin's medic-alert bracelet.++++@++++That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola.
We love celebrities!++++@++++Oh, yeah? What have they ever done for you? When was the last time Barbra Streisand cleaned out your garage? And when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger? I'll tell ya. Ray Bolger is lookin' out for Ray Bolger!
Next...++++@++++Why you little--!
I'm really looking forward to seeing Homer again. He always has the most interesting odors.++++@++++Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars.
What the -- ?++++@++++Gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-Museum-of-Hollywood-Jerks.
Pull over, you maniac!++++@++++No!
Not well. But I'll give it a shot.++++@++++Oh, God.
You killed Ron Howard!++++@++++Okay, I'll stop.
Mr. Simpson, do you have anything to say for yourself?++++@++++Yes, I do.
Or begging. I know a place that'll saw your legs off...++++@++++Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future.
Now you're dreaming.++++@++++Oh, am I?
Of course. Nuclear power.++++@++++It's the job of tomorrow... today!
Nuclear power.++++@++++Nuclear power.
I didn't quite get the point of it, Dad. Why would Lenny want someone to saw his legs off?++++@++++Well, there were script problems from day one.
Didn't seem like anybody even read the script.++++@++++That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts.
You're joining the Screen Actor's Guild?++++@++++I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits.
Fat Guy Number Three?++++@++++Good. Good.
Hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?++++@++++You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the "J" stand for?
It was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. I was mainly in it for the spanking.++++@++++But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.
You might as well. You already made up a phony film credit.++++@++++No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.
You lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.++++@++++Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name.
Hmm... I know where we might find your missing moniker. It's a bit of a drive, but on the way we can have a nice father son chat.++++@++++Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
This is the hippie commune your mother ran off to when life with me became a living hell.++++@++++Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations.
Is that... Abe Simpson? Geez, man, we haven't seen you since Woodstock.++++@++++You went to Woodstock?
Oh, Homer J., how do you keep your hair so rich and full?++++@++++Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat.
Homer J., will you teach us to make love?++++@++++Wow, I could have lived like that?
Aaanyway, I-I still think about her every time I walk by that mural she painted.++++@++++Ohh, my mother painted that for me?
She also left her old poncho.++++@++++I'll treasure this poncho forever.
Just lyin' around... never workin'... without a care in...++++@++++My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!
Whuh?++++@++++I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!
Now I know how Dean Rusk feels. G'night everybody!++++@++++Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!
Dad, do you mind? Your feet are really close to my potato.++++@++++Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures.
Homer, excuse yourself.++++@++++No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing.
And that poncho is filthy! Let me dry-clean it for you.++++@++++Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross.
I see...++++@++++Well, at least lose the bra. Free the "Springfield Two," Marge! Free the "Springfield Two!"
My eyes have been soiled!++++@++++C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing.
Homer, for God sakes, put your poncho on!++++@++++Okay, okay. Narc.
My man! You've gone granola.++++@++++Right on.
Join the hack.++++@++++That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love...
Okay, time to get back to work.++++@++++Work!? But you're hippies!
We grow our own vegetables and process them right here. And we give half the profits to war orphans.++++@++++Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave.
W-We're just trying to pay the bills, Homer. I mean, we're still hippies at heart.++++@++++Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts.
Wait. Don't you work for a nuclear power plant?++++@++++Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?
I drive a Saturn.++++@++++A Saturn?
Yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, Homer. But we've got a big order to fill.++++@++++Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
Hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage.++++@++++Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
Thanks for the tip, Homer.++++@++++Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!
Weirdos!++++@++++Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!
Oh, Lord.++++@++++What's in your brand new bag, mama?
Uh, it's that pair of Dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?++++@++++Marge. Not in front of the hippies.
Oh, please God, don't let them come in here.++++@++++Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
That was fun. I don't know if we actually freaked anyone out, but --++++@++++No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out.
Our entire shipment is ruined!++++@++++Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?
The only people who are going be freaked out are our stockholders.++++@++++I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
There won't be any more freak-outs! You're not a hippie, and you never were!++++@++++Yes, b-b-but the poncho...
Ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?++++@++++Perhaps in time.
Aw, cheer up, Dad. You make a great hippie.++++@++++Aww, you're just saying that.
And the soles of your feet are jet black.++++@++++Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet.
I know you feel bad about the juice incident, but I'm sure you can make up for it somehow.++++@++++That's it! Somehow!
W-What happened to our crops?++++@++++I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. Your business is saved!
But there weren't enough vegetables left to fill that order.++++@++++Heh. That's what I thought at first. But then I found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
Homer, those were our "personal vegetables."++++@++++Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!
Officer, please, we can explain...++++@++++Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!
Oh, for the love of... there. Now, let's crack some skulls.++++@++++Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. "UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..." Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL...
Forget the clubs. Just shoot him.++++@++++Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man.
I'm a doctor, not a gardener.++++@++++Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?
MMMennnn...onite minister will be giving a guest sermon next Sunday. Go in peace. Aaaa--++++@++++Don't make me come up there!
...men.++++@++++Woo hoo!
No, no one's "going Catholic." Three children is enough, thank you.++++@++++Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch.
I feel guilty coming here every Sunday and never actually buying anything.++++@++++Why? We're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free.
Candy Warhol? Xavier Nougat?++++@++++Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?
Oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress.++++@++++Ooooh.
Those are eight dollars a pound, sport.++++@++++Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that.
Lobsters need salt water.++++@++++I'm way ahead of you.
Dad! The fish!++++@++++Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.
Ohh, you don't sound so good. We'd better get you some cold medicine.++++@++++No problem. I picked some up at the store.
Oh, Homie, you made breakfast.++++@++++Nothing's too good for my one and only.
Ooh, so plump and juicy. He's gonna boil up nicely.++++@++++Well, I guess this is it, ol' pal. This is your big day.
The water's boiling! Quick, chuck him in!++++@++++Uh...
Come on! Chuck him in!++++@++++Okay...
Let's go! In the pot. In the pot.++++@++++But Marge, look at the little guy!
He looks like an ordinary... ow! Son of a--!++++@++++Feel that, Marge? He likes you!
Pardon me for asking, but where the hell's my stupid lobster?++++@++++We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.
Daddd...++++@++++What's your problem, Veggie? You don't even eat lobster.
Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary.++++@++++Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?
Uh, I am sick of everyone being so proud of me!++++@++++That's my girl!
And now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: State Comptroller Atkins.++++@++++Wooo!!
Who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?++++@++++Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath.
Hey, what smells so good?++++@++++Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!
Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?++++@++++Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy.
Hip hip--++++@++++Hey, I'm trying to drive here!
Hey, Dad, that light says, "Check Engine."++++@++++Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.
Oh, come on.++++@++++Relax, she just needs a little lovin'.
Because they discovered gold right over there--++++@++++It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything.
Founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from St. Joe in three days, Bloodbath Gulch quickly became known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's pay in three minutes.++++@++++Three minutes?
Uh, yes, sir?++++@++++Do we have to listen to you?
Oh, well... no, you don't... but if you have any interest in history...++++@++++I'm done.
Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?++++@++++Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!
First of all, I'm not a robot. And second, I got this metal ass in 'Nam, defending this country for lazy jerks like you. Now, what'll you have, partner?++++@++++Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!
You can get drunk when we get home.++++@++++Duh.
Let's forget this whole thing happened.++++@++++What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!
Can I go to the bathroom before we leave?++++@++++Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, "Inside the Actor's Studio." Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham.
But I really need to--++++@++++F. Murray Abraham.
There's a rest area. Pull over.++++@++++Can't stop now. We're making great time.
Can I go behind a tree?++++@++++What are you, an animal?
Please go back! You can make it my birthday present.++++@++++We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon.
But I might explode.++++@++++You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
Oh, no!++++@++++Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way.
Uh, actually, his kidneys were fine yesterday when he had his annual checkup.++++@++++Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine...
Homer, with all due respect, this x-ray reveals a textbook kidney blow-out -- which would explain those loud pops you heard.++++@++++So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?
I'm amazed you're alive now.++++@++++Oh, I blame myself for this.
Well, you could give him a kidney.++++@++++A kidney? Okay, fine.
You see, the waiting list for a kidney is very long and...++++@++++I said "fine." What is it about the word "sure" you don't understand?
Besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you.++++@++++Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow...
Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. "Gorilla Squadron," "Gorilla Island VI,"...++++@++++"Apes-A-Poppin'!" Oooh, the airline version!
Can I fluff your pillow?++++@++++Nothing's too good for me.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You're really brave to go through with this operation.++++@++++It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure.
Nah, nah, no. Makin' polenta, that's a procedure. You're talkin' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here.++++@++++Really? You think it's dangerous?
Oh, yeah. And, and even if you survive the operation --++++@++++Procedure. Deadly procedure.
Whatever. The point is, with only one kidney, you won't be able to drink yourself stupid no more.++++@++++Now you're just tryin' to scare me.
Plus they'll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. Everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.++++@++++But I don't want that.
Listen, I'm just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable.++++@++++Yeah, I guess.
And, uh, are those your original lips?++++@++++Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!
Oh, Homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it.++++@++++But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine.
I love you, son.++++@++++I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
Well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel.++++@++++You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?
Ohh, anything, sweetheart.++++@++++Blow up the hospital.
Well... I said I'd do it, so I guess I'll have to.++++@++++That's my girl.
Dr. Martins to podiatry.++++@++++Liability waiver?
Don't read it. Just sign it.++++@++++Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that.
It simply says you won't hold us responsible if you die as a result of gross negligence. It's a standard form.++++@++++Oh.
Well, if you look closely, you'll see this is a taffy shop shaped like a ship.++++@++++Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy.
Arr, what other ships have ye been on?++++@++++I've been on that one. The taffy shop.
Welcome aboard "The Ship Of Lost Souls".++++@++++The name on the back says "Honeybunch."
Arr, I've been meaning to paint over that. Now come and meet the rest of the damned. Did I mention they're lost souls?++++@++++Well, actually, you did...
Ahh, another lost soul has joined our world-weary ensemble.++++@++++Say, who are you guys?
Who are we? No one. Where are we sailing? Nowhere. Do we even exist? Who knows?++++@++++H-Heyy, let me off this thing.
Oh, don't listen to him. We exist all right.++++@++++Whew.
We wander the seven seas, trying to forget.++++@++++Forget what?
Come, stranger, join our circle of infamy. Tell us your story of en-nui.++++@++++Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed.
I stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you... you disgust even me.++++@++++Well, yeah, I know...
We make a great team, son.++++@++++Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step.
Oh, who'm I kiddin'? I'm a goner.++++@++++No you're not, Dad.
Oh, dear.++++@++++Boy, that...
Try not to move, Dad. You swallowed a lot of motor oil.++++@++++I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave...
Oh! Boy, I shouldn'ta done that.++++@++++It's a miracle! You recovered!
While we were setting your broken bones and putting your blood back in, we helped ourselves to a kidney and gave it to your father.++++@++++You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
Yes. You've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs.++++@++++Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug.
Dad, you're tickling me.++++@++++Yesss, tickling.
We'll return for the remainder of the conclusion after these messages.++++@++++Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial.
Remember, it's BI-MON-SCI-FI-CON. Be there and be square!++++@++++Well, beats work.
As you can see, you stand to save up to seventeen cents a month over the more dependable providers...++++@++++Nooooooooooo!
/ Yeah! / Star Wars!++++@++++You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!
That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!++++@++++Neeerrrds!
Who are you?++++@++++Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here!
I can't, Homer. I twisted my ankle. You guys go on without me!++++@++++Never!
Oh, my God. Someone has to go back in for Maggie!++++@++++Forget Maggie! She's gone!
Wow, that was close. Well, thanks a lot, Homer.++++@++++Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle.
I'll tell you who. Him!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, I don't think you were listening to what he just--++++@++++I said, "woo hoo."
As a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your pro-tectee. Not to your family. Not to your country. Not to Moohamed.++++@++++Even during Ramadan?
These melons represent your pro-tectees. Throughout this course, you will pro-tect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary.++++@++++Wha?
Okay, listen up! My goal is to assassinate that watermelon. Your job is to take the bullet. Go! Go! Go! Go! Pow!++++@++++Nooo!
AND I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I-E-E-I-I-I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOOOUUU!... Ha!++++@++++Clear!
You know, I really don't care for that code name.++++@++++Look out, Marge! Cat!
I know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?++++@++++Hold it! What's your clearance?
We just want to get a snack.++++@++++Access denied.
Homer! I don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.++++@++++They'll be fine in half an hour.
That's not the point. And another thing. I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--++++@++++Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...
Heh. Here's a couple of DÃ¼ffenbraus, on the house, of course.++++@++++Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'.
That "change" was a bribe.++++@++++Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time.
Thank you, Fat Tony. However, in the future, I would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it.++++@++++So, how'd you get the nickname "Legs"?
Well, that's an interesting story. It seems President Kennedy's father...++++@++++Oooh, mini-cannoli!
Dad! What a nice surprise.++++@++++Oh, get that away from me!
Can I still drink it?++++@++++Go nuts.
Those wacky gangsters. What are you gonna do?++++@++++And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!
I'm alive, you idiot! Pull me in!++++@++++A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
But the gangsters will kill me.++++@++++You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death.
All right! All right, I promise.++++@++++Shake on it?
I am not so much disappointed as I am blinded with rage.++++@++++Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down!
Aren't you scared, Dad? I mean, if I were Fat Tony, and God willing someday I will be, I'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder.++++@++++Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work.
You're guarding the mayor tonight? After Fat Tony swore revenge?++++@++++It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?
Homer, I'm, uh, not sure it's wise to go out right now. I was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the, uh... wife.++++@++++Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?
No, no, I truly do want to stay home with the... wife.++++@++++You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.
Nnyyeeeeeesss?++++@++++Do you have a table for the mayor?
Nnyyeeeeeesss.++++@++++Why do you talk that way?
Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than "Othello" with Peter Marshall.++++@++++Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!
Please, I am only here as a devotee of the lively arts. But I do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could deliver.++++@++++Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--
You moron! That's the Kiss of Death!++++@++++Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.
Ah, au gratin potatoes, that's a quality side.++++@++++Nooooooooo!!!
"... GUYS AND DOLLS. WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CRAZY GUYS AND DOLLS. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GUYS AND DOLLS...!" "AND OH THOSE DOLLS! WE'RE DANCING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH! AND GAMBLING, YEAH, YEAH, YE-AH!"++++@++++Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap.
But I'm just here to kill... Wha--++++@++++That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?
He looks awfully familiar.++++@++++I think I saw him in "Rent," or "Stomp," or "Clomp," or some piece of crap.
Show's over, Mayor!++++@++++Look out!
Homer... use... the forrr...++++@++++The force?!
The forks... use the forks...!++++@++++Oh.
I checked with the doctor. He said Mayor Quimby's gonna be fine... and I was electric as Nathan Detroit. What did you think of me?++++@++++Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent.
Ohh... cheer up, Homer. I think you made a great bodyguard.++++@++++Really? Would you say I was magnetic?
Oh, wait, here it is.++++@++++Get out of the way you--
I'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.++++@++++Oh, I can explain that. You see...
Hockey puuuuucks...++++@++++Don Rickles zinged you, Marge.
Dust!!!++++@++++Eat my dust, dust!
We'd better stop and get the car washed.++++@++++Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week.
Hey, Homer. Car's kinda dirty.++++@++++Really? You think I should get it washed?
You listen to your friends, but you never listen to me.++++@++++Hey, that's great.
Five dollars, please.++++@++++Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price?
Senior citizen's discount.++++@++++Senior citizen? Flanders?
Now we're going to pass this around a second time. Brother Ned, if you'll do the honors.++++@++++I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, "Saint Flanders" is as crooked as you or me!
/ What's he talking about? / What's he saying? / Who is he? / etc.++++@++++That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card!
Well, that's not quite true--++++@++++Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
Well, I did, but--++++@++++Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
Well, yes.++++@++++And you are how old?
You've never licked maple syrup off your lover's stomach?++++@++++You mean that one with the red paint?
No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!++++@++++Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life.
Rod, call Doctor Stein.++++@++++All right, Bart!
Never a dull moment, huh, Homer?++++@++++You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!
Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun.++++@++++Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson.
Yeah, I, I guess I do.++++@++++Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee.
How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?++++@++++Wellity, wellity, wellity...
Stop that! Will you help me or not?++++@++++Let's do it.
So what about all this meat?++++@++++Eh, the Missus will clean that up.
Now it's Marge's time to shine!++++@++++First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses.
Seems fair.++++@++++And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here.
Of course I... Oh, my stars! I can't do that.++++@++++Well that's unfortunate. It really is.
So, what happens next?++++@++++One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care.
Okay, Homer. I'm ready to learn. What's the first lesson? Just give me the topic sentence.++++@++++Gimme that!
Homer, they blew that up yesterday.++++@++++Oh yeah, right.
Ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. I'd better call Maude and tell her where I am.++++@++++Relax, I called her from the gas station.
Thanks, buddy.++++@++++Sucker.
Oh, the lights, the noise, the letter X -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. I'm overstimulated! I gotta get out of this town!++++@++++I don't think so.
If he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp.++++@++++He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death.
And now, the indestructible Lance Murdock will jump his SuiCycle over an audience member. And he'll do it while attempting to open a locked safe on his head. Any volunteers?++++@++++Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!
No, Homer, no! I wanna do something exciting, but I can't just go from zero to thirty like that! I-I could be killed.++++@++++Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?
Uh, yeah, paint. Now, it's of critical importance that you don't--++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science.
Well, actually, there are several rockets mounted to the--++++@++++Bo-ring.
Okay, he's cleared the ring of fire! Past the ring of ice! Over the dog doo stick! He's cracked the safe!++++@++++Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!
God Homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. Rumba! Yea, I was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered.++++@++++Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss.
Aw, leave me out of this, Homer. Games of chance are strictly forbidden by Deuteronomy seven--++++@++++Seven, eh?
Seven a winner.++++@++++Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers?
Oh, righty-o. One betting disk please.++++@++++One betting disk please. Watch and learn.
Aaand, fourteen black.++++@++++Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink?
Oh no. I-I mean common sense.++++@++++Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook?
You threw it out the...++++@++++Oh, never mind. Just pay attention.
More libations, my imperial conquerors?++++@++++Whuh?
More booze?++++@++++Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please.
Look at this place! We must have really painted the town last night. I have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and I don't remember a thing!++++@++++Welcome to my world.
Oh, I did it! I conquered my fears and I made up for a lot of lost livin'. And I owe it all to the Homer Simpson program.++++@++++The what now?
Well, it's about time you two woke up.++++@++++Well, of course a-- Who are you?
Here comes that vomit again.++++@++++Eeech.
Mm-hm, I'm workin' on that.++++@++++Ned, no! Think of your wives!
Take a look at this.++++@++++Ahh, precious memories.
And do you, Homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met to be your lawfully wedded wife?++++@++++What did you call me?
Do you want to get married? Married!++++@++++Sure. Sock it to me, baby.
By the power vested in me by the Chicago Outfit, I now pronounce you husbands and wives.++++@++++We are so dead.
You two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had, and we're not giving you up without a fight.++++@++++But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be.
Ginger's my wife.++++@++++Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie.
Homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?++++@++++Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.
What are we gonna do, Homer? My kids are gonna be traumatized! And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!++++@++++I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages.
Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program.++++@++++Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound.
Yoohoo.++++@++++Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.
Your behavior is.. is unconscionable!++++@++++The Moody Blues!
I want fatty.++++@++++What if we switched wives? Would that help?
For the last time, no!++++@++++Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.
We found some guys who know how to treat a woman.++++@++++But Amber, I can change!
What's the occasion?++++@++++Because we love them, Jackass.
Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?++++@++++Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
What did the aliens look like?++++@++++Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you.
I am Dennis Conroy, and heeere come your Isotopes!++++@++++Boooo!
Why do you hate the Isotopes so much, Dad?++++@++++Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything.
Even you?++++@++++Especially me.
That's a rotator cuff. His career's over.++++@++++I'm going to warm up the car.
But there's only been one pitch!++++@++++And it sucked!
Bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, and it's do or die.++++@++++"HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."
No, they lost.++++@++++Losers.
With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs.++++@++++You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens.
Quiet! We're watchin' the Isotopes!++++@++++Shut it off. They're losers.
Now we're in the championship game.++++@++++Championship?
Well, here's a die-hard fan. Sir, your beloved Isotopes are about to make history. Any thoughts?++++@++++Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo!
The inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga--++++@++++They lost? Those losers!
No, no, no, the game's not over --++++@++++Woo! Not over! Wooooo!
Nobody touched my rumaki.++++@++++Woo! Rumaki!
Isotopes!++++@++++Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!
Hey, who's on first?!++++@++++Touchdown!
Slide!++++@++++Safe!
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS / YOU GOT MUD ON YOUR FACE / BIG DISGRACE...++++@++++Whoop! Careful.
Wow, you look really hungover, Dad. What did you do last night?++++@++++Last night?
Whoa / Curfew?++++@++++Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--
Sure you do. You have the right to remain silent.++++@++++That was cold-blooded, Marge.
But it's not fair. Adults always blame kids for everything!++++@++++Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse...
What about adultery?++++@++++Not until you're older, son.
And here we are, locked inside.++++@++++Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry.
Meh.++++@++++Marge, kite.
I'm tired of that show. But I've been hearing good things about "Talk to the Hand." Tom Shales says the writing "snaps, crackles and pops."++++@++++Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life.
Hey, look what I found. Grampa's old radio. Oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?++++@++++Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think.
We Know All Your Secrets.++++@++++Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy.
Oh, Homer...++++@++++I have a problem.
Tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. Because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about Springfield's other adults.++++@++++Well, at least they've already done me.
All right, you kids come down now. We promise we won't kill ya.++++@++++Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age!
Well, you kids are always disobeying them!++++@++++Perfect.
KIDS! / YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN, NOW WE'VE HAD OUR FILL.++++@++++YEAH! / YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE MARGE FORGOT HER PILL.
We're gonna teach all of you rugrats a lesson!++++@++++Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us?
You really should have voted, Homer.++++@++++Pfft. It wouldn't have made a difference.
Happy Birthday, Dad.++++@++++Wow, a Val-U-Qual coupon book!
Doughy's has terrible pizza.++++@++++Yeah, but there's two!
Oooh, "Free foot pain analysis?"++++@++++Oh, Marge. That's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain.
I guess.++++@++++See ya, kids. Me and my Val-U-Qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! I'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and I'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic.
It is to me.++++@++++Passing out in the ocean...
Oh, you betcha... absolutely... eh-- Uh-oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. These tires won't take a balance.++++@++++They won't?
Nah. Nah. No. You hear that clunk?++++@++++No.
Well, that tells me you need four new tires.++++@++++Really?
Yeah. Legally, I can't even let you drive out of here on these.++++@++++Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?
Uh, that's it. You're fired!++++@++++No! Wait! This is all my fault! Oh, if I could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires...
Oh, I know that look. You came in for the free wheel balance and now it's costing you five hundred Simoleans.++++@++++Six with the tip.
Hey, you got off easy. I just came in to use the phone and they got me for the whole Road King package. Alignment, shocks, Armour All, stem lube...++++@++++Stem lube. Even I didn't fall for that... Although winter is coming...
Man, we are a couple of Grade "A" suckers. Wally Kogen.++++@++++Hey, I know you. We were in the same pyramid scheme.
Oh, don't remind me. "Friends Helping Friends," my ass. Say, you wanna grab a beer while we're waiting?++++@++++Yeah. I'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.
Yeah, how 'bout that Super Bowl? You goin' this year?++++@++++Me? Nah. Unless there's a coupon for it. Nah.
We've got a charter bus goin' down to the game. You help us fill it, you can ride for free.++++@++++Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?
You!++++@++++Me?!
Yeah, you. Get your hand off my wife's leg.++++@++++Sorry.
Oh, absolutely. My favorite team's in it: the Atlanta Falcons . Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I've always loved the Atlanta Falcons .++++@++++Yeah, they're good. But I wouldn't count out the... Denver Broncos .
Nah.++++@++++C'mon!...
Ahh.++++@++++Yes! Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like a domino.
I'm so happy you're going to the big game. My dream has always been to see the Bolshoi Ballet.++++@++++Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?
Wow, you've signed up quite a few people, Dad: Sea Captain, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, the Squeaky Voiced Teen...++++@++++Yeah, it's a good group.
Yeah. Not a dame in sight.++++@++++Aw, thank God! Now we can stop holding it in.
Aw, crap. It's that pip-squeak Rudy.++++@++++What is it, Rudy?
Whooo!++++@++++Hey, Troy Aikman!
Man, that hurts.++++@++++'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino.
I'm catching a pass from Dan Marino! This is the greatest moment of my...++++@++++Woo hoo! Homer Simpson with the pick!
Hey, Bubba. Hacksaw. Get that moron.++++@++++Uh-oh. Lateral, to Bart!
Who needs tickets? Tickets right here. How 'bout you, Slick?++++@++++Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl. Have you no shame, sir? I should give you a royal caning.
Hey, I'm just tryin' to make an honest buck.++++@++++Aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. Wally and I have all the tickets we need.
Yeah. See, the hologram's missing. And there's no such team as the "Spongos." And finally, these seem to be printed on some sort of cracker.++++@++++Stop eating our tickets!
Oh, how could I fall for fake tickets? Gee, the fellas are gonna be crestfallen.++++@++++Yes, if by "crestfallen" you mean "kill us." Listen, let me talk to them. Maybe I can smooth this over.
Kill 'em!++++@++++Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!
Forget it. You'll just hurt me like all the others.++++@++++Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body...
Wait, Dad, look!++++@++++Gentlemen, I have an idea.
Get back here!++++@++++We can still make the kickoff!
You got my vote.++++@++++Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?
Me? I'm Dolly Parton.++++@++++I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me the key.
Oo, look at the time. I better scoot to that halftime show. See y'all.++++@++++Man, that's gonna be some show.
Who's ready for some football?!++++@++++Football!
Yeah. Where?++++@++++You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.
Let... Go... Booze!++++@++++Y'ello...
Uh, hello, this is President Clinton.++++@++++Hey, howyadoin'?
You know, your determination and grit under extreme pressure are an inspiration. The whole country is proud of you.++++@++++Well, it's about time.
And on behalf of America, I'd like to...++++@++++Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it.
Dad, that doesn't belong to you.++++@++++But this might be my last chance to win one.
Well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, Homer. Ever thought about being a travel agent?++++@++++Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.
'Cause you can really "go places" in the travel business. Huh? Feel free to use that one.++++@++++What one?
Locked.++++@++++Phone?
Unplugged.++++@++++Dog, cat?
Aw geez, there they got me living with an African-American, a Semite-American and a Woman-American, there. And I'm glad. I love youse all. I love everybody. I wish I'd saved my money from the first show.++++@++++Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place.
Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?++++@++++You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.
It's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of Admiral.++++@++++Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, "PoliceCops." That sounds like a lethal combination.
This isn't bad.++++@++++Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
The Renaissance.++++@++++This is better.
Arrest that guy. And that's the end of that chapter...++++@++++Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?
That's not really you, Dad. He's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name.++++@++++Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa.
Another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.++++@++++Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available.
No he's not.++++@++++Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON.
Hey Homer! Homer! Check it out. Bottom of page twelve.++++@++++Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.
Hey, you're famous.++++@++++And that's the end of that chapter.
Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir, can I get your autograph?++++@++++All right. And what's the name?
You only wrote my name. Um, I wanted yours.++++@++++Take it or leave it... Carl.
So they really based that Homer Simpson character on you, huh?++++@++++Yup. Right down to the scarf.
Simp-sonnnn!!++++@++++Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid.
Hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick.++++@++++No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it.
Yeah, come on, dum-dum, do something unintelligent, there.++++@++++Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
Your character provides the comic relief. Like... Ohhh... Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now."++++@++++I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
He's about to do something stupid.++++@++++Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about...
Haw haw.++++@++++People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine.
But her forehead's on fire.++++@++++Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home.
Your catch phrase is hysterical. Please say it clearly for my answering machine tape.++++@++++Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's.
Oh, it's never enough, not for them. Once they get a taste of you, they want more and more and more. That reminds me, do you mind if my nephew kicks you in the belly?++++@++++Okay.
Aw, the flash didn't go off. Ya got another one in you, Josh?++++@++++The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!
Homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. Why don't you talk to the producers of the show? Maybe they'll make your character suave again.++++@++++Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there.
Bart?++++@++++Yeah. "Bart."
Stupid? Well, I can assure you, it happened organically.++++@++++It better have.
But then we found out that ABC had a similar project in development with Annie Potts and Jeremy Piven.++++@++++Who's Jeremy Piven?
But it scared the hell out of us. So we slapped together a cop show instead.++++@++++PoliceCops.
PoliceCops.++++@++++Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?
Oh, he's not stupid. He's a street-smart, fish-out-of-water in a world he never made.++++@++++I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.
Court finds in favor of "PoliceCops." Next case.++++@++++Then I'd like to legally change my name.
What name would you prefer?++++@++++Any of these will be fine.
Max Power??++++@++++Dynamic, isn't it?
You changed your name without consulting me?++++@++++That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude.
But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?++++@++++Yes, briefly.
And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?++++@++++Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.
But I fell in love with Homer Simpson. I don't want to snuggle with "Max Power."++++@++++Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.
Isn't that the wrong way?++++@++++Yeah, but faster.
Ah! Max Power! How's every little thing?++++@++++You remembered my name!
Well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? Keep up the good work, Max.++++@++++Mr. Power.
Sir, traditionally, a monogram is just initials.++++@++++Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important.
Very well...++++@++++And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag.
The man knows what he likes.++++@++++Just takin' care of business.
If you don't, who will, huh? Trent Steel.++++@++++Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.
Oh, heyyy, great name.++++@++++Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer.
I like a man who can poke fun at himself. Ooh, hey, my one o'clock canceled. Have you had any lunch?++++@++++Yeah, but I usually have three or four.
LEADING HIM OFF) So, where to eat? You like Thai?++++@++++Tie good. You like shirt?
When did you start liking Thai food?++++@++++When Trent Steel bought me some.
Who's Trent Steel?++++@++++He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
What's this wrapped in a banana leaf? Mmm, smells like mint.++++@++++Oh, I spit my gum in there.
Where'd you meet this Trent Steel? Moe's?++++@++++No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... Anyway, you wouldn't understand.
Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you.++++@++++For all of us. Look.
You are invited to a garden party this Saturday!++++@++++This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young, hip power couples... Like me and Debbie Pinson.
Wow, look at this place. The house number is spelled out with letters!++++@++++Get used to it, honey. From now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters.
Did you wish me to destroy this machine for you?++++@++++Nah. Just park it.
Heh. Very well.++++@++++And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.
Very nice, Ed. Your inventions continue to impress me and the entire nation.++++@++++Maarrge... President Clinton!
Oh, my Lord! I feel like Cinderella.++++@++++Me, too. Let's sing the Cinderella song.
Eh, maybe later.++++@++++Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels. Pretend you don't see him.
Ah, Max Power. Trent said I absolutely must meet you. This is fab...++++@++++Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?
I thought I knew all the players in Springfield. Where have you been hiding yourself?++++@++++Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch...
Attention, please. Attention. Um, I just wanna say how thrilled I am with this turnout. I'm proud to share my home with Springfield's best and brightest.++++@++++Hey, no problem.
We've all been blessed with privilege and success.++++@++++Woo, privilege!
Uh, but with privilege comes grave responsibility...++++@++++Whuh?!
We all have to give something back to the world that's been so good to us.++++@++++Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
We have to protect them, because trees can't protect themselves. Except, of course, the Mexican Fighting Trees.++++@++++Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
To the protest bus!++++@++++Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!
I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!++++@++++Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's "A" list, but these people are nuts.
You can't blame them for having a social conscience.++++@++++Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
Hang in there, Max. Saving the environment is a hard, grueling job.++++@++++That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it.
Man, I have really had it with you tree-huggers.++++@++++Tree-huggers...
Something funny, Nature Boy?++++@++++No, I just thought it was cute when you called him...
Keep runnin', Max!++++@++++I can't lose them!
Uh, you better call for backup, Chief!++++@++++Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
Slow down, punk!++++@++++I'm free! Woo hoo!
This is terrible.++++@++++So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?
Well, I'm glad you changed your name back to Homer Simpson.++++@++++Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey.
G'night.++++@++++Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name.
To what?++++@++++Chesty LaRue.
Chesty LaRue?!++++@++++Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire.
I don't want to be Chesty LaRue or Busty St. Claire!++++@++++Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.
That's not a fairy tale. It's just something that happened to you at Moe's.++++@++++Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...
I didn't turn it on yet.++++@++++I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!
Maybe we should not answer it, huh?++++@++++Door's unlocked.
Who is your favorite Indian pop singer?++++@++++Oh, don't make me choose.
Oh, yeah, Homer's a real go-getter.++++@++++Yeah, I'm going right to the top.
Maybe we should leave.++++@++++Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word.
You don't know what they're saying.++++@++++I'm picking it up. "Sala" seems to mean jerk. And I think "Manjula" means some kind of spaceship.
Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble.++++@++++Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'.
Either put that book down or let me drive.++++@++++Hey, they stole our idea! See, look!
Worse than ever I am afraid. My shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. Now, I fear she will leave me.++++@++++Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash.
Ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before Valentine's. Ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet Manjula.++++@++++Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
Dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the Sunday paper.++++@++++Goood dog! Good doggie! "Tax Hike Approved"? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog.
I'd love to look at SculleryWeek -- if you're through with it.++++@++++Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this.
This is about investment opportunities in Yemen.++++@++++Gimme that!
Hey, look at this one. It's a poem. From Apu!++++@++++Well, don't just gasp, read it.
Oh, how romantic!++++@++++I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
The only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.++++@++++We sold it, didn't we?
Then the bird sang "I Love The Night Life"... with clever new lyrics.++++@++++Yeah, I hate that song.
I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie.++++@++++Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day.
It's not that monkey card I found in the car, is it?++++@++++Wouldn't you like to know?
Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos.++++@++++But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!
Oh, Moe.++++@++++And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?
I got some of that myself. / Oh, screw myself.++++@++++Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!
Hey, watch it! You're all over the road!++++@++++We've gotta stop that traitor Apu.
Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?++++@++++I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.
Hey, there he goes!++++@++++Let's roll.
Uh, Homer, you're drivin'.++++@++++Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll...
A croissant? What the...? Oh, that's right. They have breakfast at Tiffany's now.++++@++++Only till eleven.
Well, this is turning out to be a total waste of time.++++@++++Not entirely.
Man, that smarts!++++@++++Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport.
I told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking.++++@++++Hey, look! It's Elton John!
I got it. I got it. Apu musta hired him to sing for Manjula.++++@++++Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
Oh, that's very sweet. Have a Grammy.++++@++++Uhhhh.
Really? I did that?++++@++++How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.
Don't be frightened. That tank's just Peace Corps surplus.++++@++++Not so fast, Apu!
Homer! What a delightful coincidence.++++@++++We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?
I have to deliver a message! It's the skywriter's code.++++@++++I am so sick of that damn code!
Stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all!++++@++++Correction. Kill us both.
Oh, galldurnit! Why won't you die?!++++@++++Ow! Prickers! Owwww!
What in the world?++++@++++Roses. So many roses.
Just when I think I have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses.++++@++++Roses.
Oh, I'm gonna snuggle your brains out.++++@++++Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!
Oh! Don't go too far. If you like cafeteria workers in Beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half.++++@++++Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!
Dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks.++++@++++I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.
Mom, to your left. He's letting you in. Go!++++@++++C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!
So long, schlubs!++++@++++Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took.
Go ahead, drool all you want. Ya can't hurt that finish. Now, rain water, that'll strip it right off. Sa-- Aw, and I shouldn't have said that. C'mon, Gil.++++@++++Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please?
Okay, you've got the undercoating, clear coating, rust proofing, underguard spray, gravelguard XJ, Vita-seal, Repelzit... but if you wanna protect the paint, you better keep it in this tent.++++@++++Will do!
Okay, here's how your lease breaks down. This is your down payment... then here's your monthly... and there's your weekly...++++@++++And that's it, right?
Yup. Oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine C.B.P., or crippling balloon payment.++++@++++But that's not for awhile, right?
Yeah, you don't see many men driving the F series.++++@++++Huh?
See? Instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.++++@++++Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this.
A pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.++++@++++Shut up! Screw you guys!
You cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid Canyonero. Why can't you drive it?++++@++++Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it.
I don't think you're gay. I just have to do my grocery shopping. Now please gimme my keys.++++@++++Fine.
Nobody will ever cut me off again!++++@++++Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what.
How could they take away my license? It feels like I lost a limb.++++@++++Well, that's a turn-off.
No, your father drives like an old lady.++++@++++At least I've got a license.
Bart, they're not here to entertain us.++++@++++I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
But Dad, lemurs are nocturnal.++++@++++Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal.
Throw your peanuts!++++@++++You throw your peanuts!
C'mon, Homer! Jump!++++@++++Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?
It's okay, Homie. You can come out now.++++@++++Ah, give me a minute...
Stone Philips again!++++@++++Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now?++++@++++Oh, I'm sure of it!
But there's only one way to find out!++++@++++I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great.
Okay, FDR is in the White House, an ice cream cone costs a nickel, and a hot new tune by Benny Goodman is hitting the charts. The year is 1939.++++@++++19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!
Let me guess. You travel back in time again?++++@++++Shut up! You haven't even been born yet.
Easy, Homer. I'll bring you back.++++@++++Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys.
Yeah, too bad we gotta work, huh, Homer? Homer?++++@++++Woo hoo! Let's party!
C'mon, move your butt! You're blocking traffic!++++@++++That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.
Come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair.++++@++++Okay.
Okay, Dad, we're ready.++++@++++Hey, that's super! See you later.
Oh, quit complaining. It's half the work of the divorced dad.++++@++++Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.
Hysterical, but I traded my turn to Lisa for her dessert.++++@++++We did a Lisa thing last month. And I'm glad we did, but now I think we should do something normal people would like.
She didn't say it yet!++++@++++Go ahead, sweetie.
The book fair?++++@++++Oh, no! Ho, ho. I'm not falling for that again. If it doesn't have Siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair.
Oh, this is perfect!++++@++++We're gonna go see Marmaduke?
It encapsulates America and makes history come alive!++++@++++What? And Marmaduke doesn't?
Sorry, Dad. My mind is made up.++++@++++This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!
I can answer that. Uncle Sam needs to spend our tax dollars on the essentials: anti-tobacco programs, pro-tobacco programs, killing wild donkeys, and Israel.++++@++++Good ol' government.
Look, they have Lincoln's hat!++++@++++Thank God for grave robbers.
America's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.++++@++++Fonzie's jacket!
Who's Fonzie?++++@++++Who's Fonzie?! Don't they teach you anything in school? He freed the squares.
Get out of Archie Bunker's chair! Now!++++@++++Relax. I'm just boning up on the ol' Constitution.
Look, he got chocolate on it!++++@++++I didn't mean to! Look!
Really, that much? It's gonna cost ten thousand dollars to repair that document.++++@++++Wha?!
Of course OmniTouch understands that real money doesn't grow on trees. Not these days.++++@++++Finally, a company that understands my needs.
We sure do. It's called caring.++++@++++So we're even then?
We prefer to think of them as "keep-in-touch towers."++++@++++It's called caring, Marge.
Plus you've increased Springfield's roaming capabilities 64 percent.++++@++++Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming.
Ugh, that antenna is an eyesore.++++@++++Just pretend it's a tree, honey. Or as we say at OmniTouch, a Progress Tree.
My room!++++@++++Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?
What happened to my room?!++++@++++Nothing. They just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and I know how much you like that sciencey stuff so I...
You gave away my room!++++@++++Come on, Lisa, try and see this from the OmniTouch Corporation's point of view.
I can't believe you did this, Dad. Why didn't you put that thing in your room?++++@++++Hm. That thought never occurred to me. Funny how your mind works in a crisis.
But where am I supposed to live?!++++@++++Lisa, what's your favorite movie?
Until you taped over it, "The Little Mermaid."++++@++++That's right, "The Odd Couple." So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson.
Homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!++++@++++Ooh, anything spicy?
Oh, that's not the point. We should report this to an OmniTouch Care-Rep. People's privacy is at stake.++++@++++Great. I'm gonna eat mayonnaise!
Ohhh! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!++++@++++Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three...
Dad, will you please tell Bart to stop squeaking his chair. I'm trying to do my homework.++++@++++Bart, stop squeaking your chair!
No-ho-ho...++++@++++Hey, that looks like fun.
Race ya!++++@++++You're on! Lisa, you play winner.
I am trying to do my homework.++++@++++Hey, you're mad at me. That wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?
Dad, why did you have to take away my room?++++@++++Maybe you'd feel better if we watched some TV together.
I just want to study.++++@++++No it's not.
That's awful!++++@++++Awful entertaining.
My tummy really hurts.++++@++++Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
Is that somebody you, Homer?++++@++++Yes it is.
Okay, then you can take Lisa to Dr. Hibbert's.++++@++++Great. Maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
Lisa I'm afraid your tummy ache may be caused by stress.++++@++++Well, that's a relief.
Yes... Anyway, when it comes to stress, I believe laughter is the best medicine. You know before I learned to chuckle mindlessly, I was headed for an early grave myself.++++@++++Give it a try, honey.
I'm really not the chuckling type.++++@++++It's true. I'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em.
Yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --++++@++++Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl.
They're not all crazy, Dad.++++@++++Sure they are, honey.
You know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. And just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!++++@++++I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart.
Dad, you don't have to go to a New Age store just for me. I know you think this stuff is stupid.++++@++++Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?
I just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.++++@++++Other cultures are fine. I'm just saying I can get along in life without a "tooth brush."
Namaste.++++@++++And a ooga-booga to you too.
May I tell you about our White Light Specials?++++@++++Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?
Well, your tongue works.++++@++++Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?
Fetal grindings. But I have a better idea.++++@++++Oh no. No freezing.
No, Mr. Simpson, this is a sensory deprivation tank. It blocks out all the external distractions that bombard our souls.++++@++++Can you pee in it?
I'll take two hours.++++@++++Me too.
You're about to take a journey into the mind. You may see and experience things that are strange and frightening. But remember, they can't physically harm you, though they may destroy you mentally.++++@++++Oh, my.
Hey...++++@++++OOH EEE OOH AH AH / TING TANG WALLA WALLA BING BANG / OOH EEE OOH AH AH / WALLA BING BANG TING TING TOOO!
You should lift with your legs.++++@++++Oh yeah... art.
Gee, I should cut Dad some slack. After all, he did take me to the ballet, and the Smithsonian exhibit... In fact, he takes me lots of places he hates.++++@++++I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
Hi, Dad. How was it?++++@++++I went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. How was yours?
Pretty cool. But now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?++++@++++Like what?
Well, you told her, Dad.++++@++++You better believe I did.
You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.++++@++++Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see...
Not you.++++@++++Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...
I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed.++++@++++Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?
You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.++++@++++Didn't I?
Well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... We call it, uh, "Sir Loin-A-Lot." It's, uh, the size of a Boogie-board.++++@++++Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs.
Ladies and gentlemen... This brave man has accepted the Sir Loin-A-Lot challenge. He will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin.++++@++++They like me because I'm brave.
Uh, if you want some friendly advice, pal, I wouldn't tackle the big'un right away.++++@++++Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--
Red Barclay's my name. I'm a trucker, and I've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. Take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns.++++@++++Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?
It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody.++++@++++Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly...
No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread!++++@++++Huh? Oh, right. The steak.
Oh, humans are so ridiculous. He's not even halfway through Walter and he's already hallucinating.++++@++++Lousy drunks. I'll show them.
The winner and still champion, Reliable Red Barclay!++++@++++My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?
There goes the finest trucker who ever lived.++++@++++He called me "Greenhorn." I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had.
In 38 years, he never missed a shipment. But I guess this is one delivery ol' Red won't be making.++++@++++Oh yes he will! And on time, too!
Oh no. Oh, no...++++@++++I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer.
Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!++++@++++Don't you have school?
Don't you have work?++++@++++Ah, touchÃ©.
Good-bye, Homer.++++@++++That didn't sound like you meant it.
Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip.++++@++++That's more like it. So long, suckers!
Why? You already know I'm here, don't ya?++++@++++Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.
Well, you're not really a trucker now.++++@++++Oh, yeah? My left arm says different.
Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days.++++@++++Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.
If you wanna be my lover / You gotta get with my friends / Makin' love forever / Friendship's where that ends / If you wanna be my lover...,if you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends makin love forever friendships where that ends if you wanna be my lover,25++++@++++Yeah... the open road.
No, Dad. He wants you to blow your horn.++++@++++Ohhh.
A little more high-test, darlin'?++++@++++Sure thing, Gwenn.
I'll be right back with your pie, hon.++++@++++Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal.
I suppose.++++@++++Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife.
Will that be all, sweetie?++++@++++For now...
What about... Erika?++++@++++It ate everybody.
Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too.++++@++++Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule.
Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours.++++@++++Ten hours?! We gotta roll!
Well, Congress is racing back to Washington to outlaw these...++++@++++Sold!
Hey! You can't take that many pep pills at once!++++@++++No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
Yeah, that Navitron Auto-Drive System's made our jobs cushier than ever.++++@++++The what now?
With this baby drivin' your truck for ya, all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow.++++@++++The trucks drive themselves?
Sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! Didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'?++++@++++Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often.
We get 40 bucks an hour to drive these rigs. You think anybody'd hire us if they knew we weren't really drivin' the trucks?++++@++++Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret.
Well, well. / What's that? / Will wonders never cease?++++@++++Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?
He hit us!++++@++++Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity.
Dad, they're trying to kill us!++++@++++Oh, why do all my trips end like this?
Dad, stop!++++@++++Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy.
What are you doing?++++@++++I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.
/ Simpson, you'd better turn that thing...!++++@++++We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way.
I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red. The risk is unacceptable.++++@++++I'm not Red, I'm Homer.
Yep. You're gonna make it, Dad. And somewhere up there, I bet Red is saying thanks.++++@++++Ten-four, dead buddy.
All right, let's see... Artichokes... aannnd migrant workers. Lookin' good. So, where is ol' Red anyway?++++@++++Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag.
Yeah, that sounds like Red, all right.++++@++++Well, son. I guess it's time to go home.
Any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?++++@++++No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide.
Are you crazy? I'm not driving a trainload of napalm to Springfield!++++@++++Thank you.
And as we pass the collection plate, please give as though the person next to you were watching.++++@++++Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever.
Who put this wicked idol in the collection plate?++++@++++Relax, I found it in the dumpster.
Oooo. What a beautiful garden. It's almost like paradise.++++@++++Heads up!
Hey, Chief, he splashed me.++++@++++'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve.
Uh, I guess.++++@++++Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib.
Speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?++++@++++Is there!
Good morning, Adam. Any bacon for you, then?++++@++++Don't mind if I do!
Oh Adam, you're too kind.++++@++++No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.
I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit.++++@++++No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives.
Oh, how cute. Let's call this little guy a "groundhog..."++++@++++Sorry, I already gave him a name. "Land monster."
Really? Well, what do you call that thing on the branch?++++@++++Branch monster.
Quite so, mum. I recall one of the dinosaurs had a bite and well, that was the last of -- Egad!++++@++++Why won't you be art?!
Please stop eating that. God's gonna furious.++++@++++You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.
Well, it is a sin to waste food...++++@++++And you keep saying we need to do things together...
Adam, say something.++++@++++Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people?
Lovely day in paradise, isn't it?++++@++++Yeah, just like yesterday.
Today I'm featuring mouth-watering pork ribs. Tuck in, then!++++@++++I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever.
I'm toiling! What does it look like?++++@++++This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole "Applegate" thing.
Well, it's a little late for apologies now.++++@++++Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?
I'll be fine. Just give me a second to... ugh...++++@++++C'mon, Eve. Hurry!
And after I created my fingers to the bone for you I... My unicorn! Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?++++@++++Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord.
Oh, shut up. You are so banished.++++@++++Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?
King Solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute. They each claim ownership of this pie.++++@++++The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie.
Oh, how embarrassing. Oh, we slept right through church.++++@++++Eh, it's not the end of the world.
It's the Rapture. And I never knew true love.++++@++++I never used those pizza coupons.
Oh, right. The sins.++++@++++Where do you think you're going, Missy?
I said Homer!++++@++++You throw da can away...
You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint.++++@++++But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store.
And you could at least get that snake out of the piano...++++@++++Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?
Hey, get off my case. The only reason I'm working here is 'cause I'm trying to get a date with "Mom."++++@++++Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox.
You mean the janitor's closet? Ha!++++@++++I'd like to return this barbecue kit.
Hi, I'm Doug Vaccaro. You know me as Chip, the wisecracking assistant on the hit sitcom, "Toolin' Around."++++@++++A man in an apron!
Or if you're not into chicken...++++@++++No, no, I'm into chicken.
Light-hearted apron not included. Snapping fingers may not make food appear.++++@++++How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?
Can I burn evidence in it?++++@++++We can all burn evidence in it.
Dad, I really need to rest my back.++++@++++Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over.
All returned items must be in a box and accompanied by a receipt.++++@++++Well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here.
Yeah, hold on there, Santa Claus. That box is for toys only.++++@++++Well, of course. Any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. It teaches them while they learn.
Yeah, nice try, Saint Nick. Now hit the road, Kris Kringle.++++@++++But, but...
Homie, someone's at the door. They want to talk to you about some sort of car accident.++++@++++Take the kids out back.
Mr. Simpson? I believe something of yours struck my car yesterday.++++@++++Oh yeah? Prove it.
That's your license plate, isn't it?++++@++++Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000.
I'm not here to sue you. My name is Astrid Weller. I own an art gallery and I'd love to display your piece.++++@++++You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...
Art isn't just pretty pictures. It's an expression of raw human emotion. In your case, rage.++++@++++Oh, I got that, lady.
Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots.++++@++++This lady says I'm an artist.
Your husband's work is what we call "Outsider Art." It could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee.++++@++++In high school I was voted "Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!"
Well, you should be very excited, because outsider art couldn't be hotter.++++@++++So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...
Dad, chew with your mouth closed. You're losing your mystique.++++@++++Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns.
Congratulations, Homer -- you're now a professional artist!++++@++++Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!
Where are you going with that junk, Dad?++++@++++I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable.
Homie, I'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?++++@++++Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr.
That's my life you're describing.++++@++++I think I remember my own life, Marge.
Well, if it'll help - Um, Mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy.++++@++++Good work, honey. Keep it comin'.
I must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. Bon soir.++++@++++What do we owe you, Moe?
Nothin', nothin'. Just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity.++++@++++All right.
Wonderful news, Homer.++++@++++Is it about pies?
Uh, no. We're going to hold a show devoted entirely to you.++++@++++Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!
I'm happy for you. Now g'night.++++@++++Good night.
No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life.++++@++++Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like.
That's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if I, I don't know, entered a belching contest?++++@++++Frankly, I'd be a little turned on.
You don't understand.++++@++++Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good.
Well, I guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy.++++@++++Now you're making sense. Good night.
Homer is the most dangerous artist on the Springfield scene. Now, let's see what surprises he has for us tonight.++++@++++I give you "Botched Hibachi." The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection.
I'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive.++++@++++What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff.
Come on, Gunter, Kyoto. If we hurry we can still catch the heroin craze.++++@++++Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me.
Homer, I know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same.++++@++++Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been.
Who?++++@++++You can call him Ray / Or you can call him J. / Or you can call him Ray J. / But you doesn't have to call him...
It's so exciting to do something cultural together.++++@++++Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.
A Claes Oldenburg. He's a European who defied convention and embraced American popular culture.++++@++++He must be a hundred feet tall.
Now this is a Joseph Turner. In an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the Venetian Canals.++++@++++It's glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!
And Picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. By the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. They call it his "angry jerk" period.++++@++++Mmmm, split-pea.
Any ideas yet?++++@++++No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil.
Soup's on, fat boy!++++@++++Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
Homer... Homer...++++@++++Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
Well, Dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like Christo.++++@++++Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
No, Christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. He once wrapped the Reichstag in plastic.++++@++++Not the Reichstag!
Oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the California highway...++++@++++Why'd he do that?
To make the world a more magical place, I guess. Although they did blow over and kill some people.++++@++++Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite.
No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring.++++@++++Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town.
See you in hell, "God Bless This House."++++@++++So long, The Simpsons!
It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies.++++@++++Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
Are you sure this is art, not vandalism?++++@++++That's for the courts to decide, son.
Oh, that can't be good.++++@++++People of Springfield, behold my latest work!
Homer, what have you done?++++@++++It's conceptual art -- the Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice without the black plague. What do you think?
Well, Homer, I have to admit, you created something people really love. You truly are an artist.++++@++++No, I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family.
Ohh...++++@++++Is that our house?
That's us.++++@++++Are we kissing?
Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!++++@++++Shut up, shut up, shut up!
You papier mache'd my cat?!++++@++++Just for the prototype, honey.
Good work, Dad.++++@++++It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
Ow!!++++@++++God bless America!
Oh! / Springs!++++@++++They picked Springy! In your face, Patty and Selma!
"Coming! Hey, hey, hey! Children, children, future, future..."++++@++++I've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
Are you talking to me or the beer?++++@++++To you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover.
Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman, "Kiss me or I'll crush you."++++@++++He says what we're all thinking.
That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.++++@++++Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey.
Sounds good to me!++++@++++I'llgetit.
Delivery for Homer Simpson.++++@++++Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came!
But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.++++@++++Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs.
Ow! My eye! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!++++@++++Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item.
Homer, get outta here.++++@++++Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts.
Are you okay?++++@++++Some second degree burns, but some first class burgers.
I want you to get rid of these springs.++++@++++But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa!
Give me my baby!++++@++++"D" it up, Marge. I'm goin' to the hole.
I want these springs out of our house today.++++@++++You flush one down / It swirls around / Nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
You're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?++++@++++Of course not! "Nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / Nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."
What the heck's going on?++++@++++A hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. A hundred and thirty-five springs...
I don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. When was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?++++@++++Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry.
Get a horse!++++@++++Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?
We're walking, Homer.++++@++++There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.
Oh, look! There's the store where I buy my yarn. But you don't want to buy your buttons there.++++@++++Pew, well, I dodged a bullet.
Where'd you get that champagne?++++@++++Clown.
All this commotion just for a store?++++@++++Hey, it's not just a store. It's a "mega" store. "Mega" means "good." And "store" means "thing."
I do! I do! / Right here!++++@++++I DO!
Ha! All right. What's your name, young man?++++@++++I don't know. Just give me the dollar.
Well, I hope this starts you on your way to a great fortune. Now, who wants the second dollar?++++@++++I do!
Now...++++@++++I do.
I need your help. I want to be loved.++++@++++I see. Well, I'll need some beer.
I want you to look at me the way I saw you look at Arthur Fortune.++++@++++Oh, Arthur Fortune!
Yes! That's the look I'm looking for. What would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?++++@++++Well, you don't have to call me slovenly.
Welcome to Mensa, Lisa.++++@++++Well, how 'bout donating money to charity? Lots of crazy old coots do that.
Take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the Springfield Hospital.++++@++++Can do.
Well, I will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, Teedily deedily dee dee. Teedily dee dee dee. Woo hoo hoo. Hee hee hee.++++@++++Gee, I feel bad. If people knew the real Monty Burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you.
Oh, I think this really sucks.++++@++++Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people.
All right, let's get this geezer out quick so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.++++@++++You see white people have names like "Lenny," whereas, black people have names like "Carl."
That didn't go well, did it?++++@++++Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.
Oh... What's the use? I'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like Arthur Fortune.++++@++++Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully.
And a stunt like that impresses people?++++@++++Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!
Well, if a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time.++++@++++A sober Irishman?
Ach. The whole town's turned out. I've never seen them so excited.++++@++++Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you.
Aye.++++@++++Good. Good. One more.
Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?++++@++++Uh, to work in your power plant?
The beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt.++++@++++Check.
We're the laughingstock of the town.++++@++++Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!
Nay. 'Tis merely Loch Ness High School's discarded Homecoming float.++++@++++No way! Aberdeen rules!
Tough luck, Simpson.++++@++++Come on, Nessie. One more pull.
I was really starting to enjoy Ethnic Mismatch Comedy #644. I've never heard so many Viagra jokes in thirty seconds.++++@++++Shuuuut uppa you mouth.
Sponsored by "Grandma Plopwell's." The low-fat pudding that's approved for sale... by the government!++++@++++All right, a gross-out contest! Grandma Plopwell, you've done it again.
Next up, Homer and his amazing Reddenbacher dreamcoat, with a number he calls, "Kernel Knowledge."++++@++++I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three...
All right, judges? Who is our winner?++++@++++Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!
An Open Letter to the People of Springfield: Today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding.++++@++++Look, I got runner-up prize.
You won second place?++++@++++No. But I got it.
Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?++++@++++Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale.
Dad, stop kidding around. Look, they printed my letter.++++@++++Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here.
Well, I'm sure someone had the time to read it.++++@++++I envy them.
Oh, yes. Your name?++++@++++Uh... Geraldo... Simpson.
All right, Mr. Simpson...++++@++++Who told you?
Don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. Many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives.++++@++++Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?
Well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body.++++@++++Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a "traditional" Santa Claus.
Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people.++++@++++Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over.
Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands...++++@++++Up-bup-bup-bup.
Are you ready in there, Mr. Simpson?++++@++++Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
Just come out.++++@++++Please be kind.
You look fantastic. Let me just adjust my lens here.++++@++++Now you're sure this will save my marriage?
That's too clever. You're one of them!++++@++++Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
All right, let's do this thing.++++@++++It's time to get Homer-erotic.
Oh, Homie.++++@++++Houston, we have a problem. A sexy problem.
Homie? Well, look at you...++++@++++Grrr. I'm gonna to maul you.
Wooh, wooh. Look at those silk pillows. It's like the set of some high-class porno film!++++@++++No, no. It's just our basement.
Hold on, wha-- That's our basement?++++@++++Yeah, so? Come on! More kissing!
It looks so elegant. And all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. You've got to show me exactly what you did.++++@++++But I was gonna score...
Silence. I don't need anyone to talk for me except this voice-box. You have clearly been corrupted by power. For shame!++++@++++Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
Lisa, thank God you're okay.++++@++++Did you have fun with your robot buddy?
Who's up for some beers?++++@++++I am.
Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer. I may have to steal it.++++@++++Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
I didn't say that.++++@++++Yes, I did.
Dad, it's not...++++@++++"Gigabytes!" They've done it again. Gigabytes. Wait, this isn't "Weird." Why, there's no magazine called "Weird," is there?
Hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in Springfield! Will you take me, Dad? Please? I'll show you how to order pizza over the Internet...++++@++++The Internet? Is that thing still around?
Bart! The Internet is more than a global pornography network. It's a...++++@++++Come on, Lisa! Monkeys!
Wow, Dad, you're surfing like a pro.++++@++++Oh yeah. I'm betting on Jai-Alai in the Cayman Islands, I invested in something called News Corp...
Dad, that's Fox!++++@++++Ahh! Undo! Undo! Uhh.
Dad, do we have any money left?++++@++++Well, let's check the old bank account.
We were robbed?!++++@++++You seem to know an awful lot about this for an "innocent person."
We were saving that money for our family vacation. Now we're gonna have to start all over again.++++@++++Ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, I'll get us the money. Even if I have to get a second job.
Evening, neighbor. Low on funds again?++++@++++Yes, sir.
Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay.++++@++++I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door.++++@++++Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine...
Oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. They were evidence in a murder trial!++++@++++Sweet.
We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar.++++@++++Go on...
I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.++++@++++Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right.
Are you tired of missing out on the good things in life? Family vacations, jet packs, Solid Gold dancers...++++@++++There's only three left in the world!
Squeeze every penny! Squeeze every penny!++++@++++I'm squeezing... I'm squee-zing it. Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand.
Eww...++++@++++Wow, this plankton's only 33 cents.
Um, according to the Mexican Council of Food, this expired two years ago.++++@++++Sure, by their standards, but we live in America.
This also says it can cause red tide poisoning.++++@++++But it's so cheap.
Homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom.++++@++++A little late for "could've's," Marge.
Come on, Transylvania.++++@++++No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long.
C'mon, Homer! Japan!++++@++++No, no Japan. Jamaica! I wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side.
Never mind. Looks like the Flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.++++@++++Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?
Come on, Homer, Japan will be fun. You liked "Rashomon."++++@++++That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we want to see Japanese people we could have gone to the zoo.
I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies.++++@++++Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom.
To-ga! To-ga! Toga 2000!++++@++++Marge, they stole my idea!
Homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open.++++@++++I don't have time for that.
Mom, Lis! Check it out. Dad's on TV.++++@++++Ohh, yeah...
What the--?++++@++++Oh, all right.
Robots be right back.++++@++++Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.
Me too. Let's go to an authentic Japanese noodle house!++++@++++The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.
Don't ask me! I don't know anything! I'm product of American education system. I also build poor quality cars and inferior-style electronics.++++@++++Oooh, they got our number.
Oh my goodness, Homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars.++++@++++It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
But you promised me we'd do something Japanese.++++@++++Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!
Hey, look. Isn't that Woody Allen?++++@++++Looks like he's doing a commercial.
Says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.++++@++++Hmmm...
Tubby?++++@++++Hey, that's mine!
Congratulations. I am the Emperor and...++++@++++Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus.
Your wife has paid your bail, Mr. Simpson-san.++++@++++Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
Now can we do something Japanese?++++@++++Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori.
Honey, I know you want to see Japan, but we're down to our last million yen.++++@++++Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese.
Oh, it's beautiful, Dad.++++@++++It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck.
Be careful. We need that money to get home.++++@++++Shimatta baka-me!
KNIFE-AH GOES IN, GUTS-AH COME-AH OUT, THAT'S-AH WHAT OSAKA SEAFOOD CONCERN IS ALL ABOUT.++++@++++This sucks. What else is on?
Don't patronize me! Now, Simpson family, have you picked a wish?++++@++++Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown.
Now our gameshows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance.++++@++++Ignor-- what?
Okay, let's begin. Our categories are "OW, THAT HURTS," "WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?" and "PLEASE LET ME DIE."++++@++++Do "OW THAT HURTS."
I had an inkling.++++@++++Could someone please whack my hernia back in?
Mr. Simpson, we'll cut you down as soon as you answer one question about Japan.++++@++++Is the answer Japan?
Congratulations Simpsons, the airline tickets are yours. All you have to do is to pick them up...from inside that volcano.++++@++++Why are you so cruel?
This vacation really blows.++++@++++Well, at least we're past the lightning round.
Lisa!++++@++++Marge! Your shoe!
Oh, I'm afraid this might be the end.++++@++++Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock.
Don't worry, that "lava" is just Orangeade made by our sponsor, Osaka Orangeade Concern.++++@++++It burns! It burns!
It's loaded with wasabi. Kudos, Simpsons, you have won your freedom!++++@++++Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame.
When we get to thirty-five thousand feet, he usually does let go. So, from there on out all we have to do is worry about Mothra and uh, we do have reports he's tied up with Gamra and Rodan at the present time. Thank you very much.++++@++++Undo! Undo!
Test drive the Elec-taurus today and get a free gift.++++@++++My children deserve to see me get a free gift.
I'm proud of you, Dad. Buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the Earth's supply... You're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?++++@++++But I like the nice things you said about me.
Well, that shut me up.++++@++++Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos.
Well, it's always nice to meet people concerned about the environment.++++@++++What kind a mint?
Boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier.++++@++++Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too.
Ah! Dad, you're headed for the harbor!++++@++++Relax, we're in an electric car.
Hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is.++++@++++We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
I know, but we didn't.++++@++++Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now.
They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring Mel Gibson!++++@++++Who else is in it?
Who cares? Mel Gibson!++++@++++Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny.
Were you or Lenny ever named sexiest man alive?++++@++++Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny.
Besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. People magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... Homer, let's make love!++++@++++Okay...
Of course, Homey. Aren't you thinking about me?++++@++++I will now.
"And he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever does. Because of one plain simple rule: Love thy neighbor..."++++@++++Bo-ring.
It's not boring. He's passionate about government.++++@++++At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
Excellent. / That man knows how to filibuster.++++@++++Well, that was a stinker.
I liked it. It was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing.++++@++++Oh, you're just saying that because your "boyfriend" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith.
Eh, yes sir?++++@++++Got a pencil?
There you go.++++@++++Thanks.
I'm looking for Homer Simpson.++++@++++And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!
Quiet! Dad's gonna get his butt kicked by Mel Gibson! Knock his teeth out, Homer!++++@++++Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?
Mr. Simpson, I need your help.++++@++++Huh?
I think you're right about my movie and I want you to help me make it better.++++@++++Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!
But, Dad, I thought you hated...++++@++++Shuut-uup...
Don't sell your husband short, Mrs. Simpson.++++@++++She's always doing that, Mel.
Homer is a brutally honest man, completely tactless and insensitive.++++@++++Guilty as charged.
I don't have much time, Homer. Will you come to Hollywood with me?++++@++++You had me at "Hello."
Dodge Caravan.++++@++++Sweet.
Can I stay with you, Dad?++++@++++Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks.
Well even if he is, big deal.++++@++++I mean Lisa.
You want me to replace the villain with a dog? I mean nobody'll know what's going on!++++@++++They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer. I'm sorry I dragged you out here. L-Let me pay your bus fare home.++++@++++Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...
The filibuster scene? That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite!++++@++++And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action.
You really think the end is boring?++++@++++Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that.
Hmm, I guess it is a little flat. Okay, let's reshoot the ending. I'll call the hair and make-up ladies. You see if the teamsters will work for free.++++@++++Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?
Okay, this new ending...++++@++++... we-shot-last-night...
... is a little different than what we had, but I think you'll like it. It's missing some sound effects and the computer guys haven't added the twinkle in my eye...++++@++++Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!
I move we impose some serious term limits!++++@++++I second that motion...
But this was gonna be the studio's prestige picture. Like "Howard's End," or "Sophie's Choice."++++@++++Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.
I make movies for guys like him.++++@++++Yeah, guys like me.
Who are you, anyway?++++@++++Do the words "Executive Producer" mean anything to you?
Executive Producer?++++@++++We'll talk.
You put me down, you big lummox! Je-eedd!!++++@++++Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!
Homer! Land mine!++++@++++I'm on it.
Well, I've been told I can play anywhere from 28 to...++++@++++Sorry I asked.
Well, that's it Homer. We should've known better than to match wits with studio executives.++++@++++Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet.
Homer, what are you doing here?++++@++++No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!
Oh, forget it, Homer, let's just give 'em the stupid movie.++++@++++Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. "Lethal Weapon" showed us that suicide is funny.
That really wasn't my intention.++++@++++Before "Lethal Weapon 2", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time.
Movies mean that much to you, Homer?++++@++++They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
Oh sorry, honey, I used up the last roll on that man I thought was Judge Judy.++++@++++Well, I think we lost 'em.
Will you please tell me the rest of the plan?!++++@++++It's your plan, from "Braveheart." Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered.
No, they didn't. They attacked us in a horribly bloody battle. Remember?++++@++++Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it...
Homer, are you okay?!++++@++++I think so.
That digital sound really lets you hear the blood splatter.++++@++++I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies.
I'm Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter and you'll be hearing from my attorney!++++@++++/ Ow!
It's not your fault, Homer. I guess there's just no room in today's crazy, gentle America for violent dinosaurs like us.++++@++++How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?
I blame the Internet. And the return of swing music.++++@++++Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture.
I don't.++++@++++Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?
Thank you for coming.++++@++++Thank you for getting me out of work.
Your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true.++++@++++Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right.
But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. Just look at this pattern.++++@++++Hey, that looks like Bart.
How should I know? The point is, A.D.D. makes children restless and easily distracted.++++@++++Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer.
... Unless you're willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous...++++@++++Candy bar?
Good Lord. He's gotten into the Pep Closet!++++@++++I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.
Check this out.++++@++++They become your slaves...
How will we get Bart to take these?++++@++++It's all about trust, honey.
Medication?++++@++++Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
I don't want to take drugs.++++@++++Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used drugs: Brett Butler.... Tim Allen...
Tommy Lee...++++@++++Andy Dick...
He's just flamboyant.++++@++++Yeah, and I'm a size four.
Dad, I admit I have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer.++++@++++Why you little...!
Nice try, Homer.++++@++++Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...
All right. I'll do it for you.++++@++++Way to guilt him, Marge!
No, but here's a book called "Chicken Soup for the Loser" that gave Bill Buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats.++++@++++Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...
I think it's the bright blue pants. I mean, you're not on a golf course.++++@++++Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs...
That's gonna save all kindsa travel time.++++@++++You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
Quiet, everybody!++++@++++Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say "Whatsa matta you?" in Turkish.
Neyin War? DÃ©rdine?++++@++++And look at this. A cheese grater!
A guy could do great things with a gadget like that.++++@++++Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at...
That's right. You stay on the ball, you stay on the wall.++++@++++He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills.
Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!++++@++++Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday.
I was thinking of something a little more... adult.++++@++++Oh... Marge!
And then afterwards...++++@++++Really? With butterscotch on it?
All right, girls, tops off. It's showtime!++++@++++Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband.
I heard about a new bar where men dance with men. Doesn't that sound adorable?++++@++++Well, sure, if it's true.
I'm so glad you're here. Bart's really acting funny.++++@++++Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?
It can read your electronic organizer from space.++++@++++Even mine?
Who else? Major League Baseball.++++@++++Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!
Aagghh!++++@++++Hey, you found my needlenose pliers.
Any other strange behavior?++++@++++Wake up, honey!
This carboxyl group sometimes causes problems.++++@++++After we trusted you...
Oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero.++++@++++We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea...
I don't think he has diarrhea.++++@++++But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?
Homer, you're supposed to be hunting for Bart!++++@++++I'm on top of it.
What a day. First the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this!++++@++++My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie.
Dad, that junkie is your son!++++@++++Why don't you just tell everybody?
Not the church! Jesus lives there!++++@++++The frame store! You monster!
Hey, at least I got to see some cool colors.++++@++++And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
Why is the zero made out of glass?++++@++++Who cares? That man can really slug.
Dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?++++@++++Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered.
Dingus!++++@++++God bless you, Nelson Muntz.
I'm no hero. I just like to hit people in the head.++++@++++Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!
Dad, that's an ambulance.++++@++++Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards.
Welcome to the Springfield Shopper, established in 1883. The newspaper was founded by Johnny Newspaperseed... a fourteen-year-old boy who roamed America, founding newspapers.++++@++++If he's so smart, how come he's dead?
Check it out, Dad. You can print out the headline from the day you were born.++++@++++Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
Who are you and why are you ruining my retirement party?++++@++++I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.
Well, at least you like the food.++++@++++Oh, I like food all right.
I get the picture.++++@++++I'LL EAT EGGPLANT / I COULD EVEN EAT A BABY DEER... LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... WHO'S THAT BABY DEER ON THE LAWN, THERE...
Enough already!++++@++++Sorry.
Hey, listen, I just had a thought. We're looking for a new food critic. Someone who doesn't immediately pooh-pooh everything he eats.++++@++++No, it usually takes a few hours.
Look, I'd like to give you a tryout. Write a 500 word sample review. If it passes muster, we'll put you on staff.++++@++++Thanks for the chance. You won't never regret this, Mr. Editing Guy!
You know, Homie, the "E" doesn't work on that typewriter.++++@++++We don't need no stinkin' "E". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!
This is a joke, right? I mean, this is the stupidest thing I've ever read.++++@++++What's wrong with it?
Well, you keep using words like "pasketti" and "momatoes," you make numerous threatening references to the U.N., and at the end, you repeat the words "Screw Flanders" over and over again...++++@++++It was so hard to get to 500 words...
Aw, look, Homer, I'm sorry, but...++++@++++No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review.
Well, we went to PatÃ© Labelle last week. How 'bout that?++++@++++Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious...
The food is delicious.++++@++++That's brilliant. And they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is .
Hm. What's the English equivalent for ? I'd say... transcendent.++++@++++How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
Uh, I don't think so.++++@++++We make a good team. A groin-grabbingly good team!
497... 498 words. Hmph.++++@++++How about "screw Flanders"?
Bon Appetit.++++@++++Aw, they're both good.
Not bad... not bad at all. We're gonna run this on page one! Of Section H-2.++++@++++Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
That takes four hours!++++@++++Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.
This is so exciting, Homie. Your first restaurant review.++++@++++Marge, shh! It's important that no one know that I'm a food critic.
If anything appears to be moving, that's just freshness. Arrr.++++@++++Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!
Yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street.++++@++++Why you little...
Wow, my first published article. Although someone else's name is on it.++++@++++Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...
And there's that awful script from The Cable Guy!++++@++++Let me see.
The food is exquisite...++++@++++And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
I never knew everything was so good.++++@++++Look, Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!
Hey Homer, c'mere!++++@++++Are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?
Some of your fellow critics wanted to meet you ... this is Garth Trelawny, TV critic...++++@++++Why, you... You made them cancel "Platypus Man!"
Homer! This is our Theater Critic, Daphne Beaumont.++++@++++And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!
Homer, please!++++@++++Sorry.
Jamie Kilday, farm supply critic. Just got back from the gopher poison show in Paris. Let me tell you something, people. The days of clubbing them with a baseball bat are over.++++@++++For you, perhaps.
Listen, we've been meaning to have a talk with you about your reviews. Everything's a rave! Nine thumbs up? What the hell is that?++++@++++I've given out my share of bad reviews.
Well, the only bad review you gave was to a slice of pizza you found under the couch.++++@++++It lost some points 'cause it had a Hot Wheel on it.
Good Lord, man, you're a critic! You don't have to like everything. E.g., my latest review: "We see John Deere has come out with this year's line of rototillers. Surprise surprise, they're green. I say it's time to send John Deere a 'Dear John.'"++++@++++Oh, that's classic.
You don't have to patronize me.++++@++++Okay.
It's not!?++++@++++Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy.
Dad, that's so mean.++++@++++The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.
But what if someone bad tells me to...++++@++++Always.
I chop-a you good!++++@++++Well, I hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. Hm, I seem to be missing a piece of my ear. TouchÃ©!
Who wants pork chops?++++@++++Mm.
You always liked my pork chops.++++@++++Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: "Shake" and "Bake."
You like Shake and Bake. You used to put it in your coffee.++++@++++People change, Marge. My palate has grown more sophisticated.
Oh, yeah? What's a palate?++++@++++Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!
Dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?++++@++++People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
Not anymore. I don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.++++@++++Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back.
Ruff!++++@++++"Rough!" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night.
Chewy?++++@++++Chewy! That's inspired.
Homer, what gives with this review? You say the salad tastes like "bark", the potatoes were very . This reads like it was written by a dog.++++@++++Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.
Listen, you gotta shape up. Next week is the "Taste of Springfield" festival, and you'll be reviewing every restaurant in town. Remember, people have certain expectations about the Lifeways section.++++@++++Really? Like what?
Homie, my women's intuition's acting up. Something bad's going to happen if you go in there.++++@++++Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere.
I'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.++++@++++Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me.
We can find him faster by splitting up. You take fried foods. You take salty snacks. I'll take desserts. Break!++++@++++Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie...
A rude Frenchman? Well, I never!++++@++++Ooh, sweet.
It's gonna kill you!++++@++++Eh, I've had a good run.
Don't! Uh... um... It's low-fat!++++@++++Noooo!
Oh, he likes eggs.++++@++++Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you.
What bad things? Why?++++@++++Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will.
Uh, Dad?++++@++++I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!
I still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.++++@++++But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.
I'm having a hard time seeing. Homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?++++@++++Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
Ned Flanders!++++@++++He's dead!
They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.++++@++++Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is...
Neddy? Where have you been?++++@++++Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily.
Oh, I'm so relieved. Whenever you go on one of your late night fog walks, I get so worried.++++@++++Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies.
Well, come on down, you goofy roofy.++++@++++Wow, it sure is slippery up here.
My pies are done!++++@++++Aww, she missed it.
... And now Ned's best friend will say a few words. Homer?++++@++++When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over...
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!++++@++++Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife.
Stop winking.++++@++++We'll miss you, buddy.
No more murders.++++@++++But you got to kill...
Who could be calling at this hour?++++@++++Y'ello?
I know you're alone.++++@++++Who is this?
Is this Maude Flanders?++++@++++No, it's Homer.
You can't kill the undead, silly.++++@++++He's undead, all right.
Yeah...++++@++++Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?
Remember, you're vulnerable to Kryptonite!++++@++++Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood.
Hey, Homer. Weren't you the plant's Y2K Compliance Officer?++++@++++Absolutely.
It musta been hard debugging all those computers, huh Homer?++++@++++Doin' what now?
You did fix them, right Dad? Because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world.++++@++++That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified.
Oh, no. It's happening.++++@++++Uh-oh.
There goes the clothesline.++++@++++Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed...
It's got a computer chip in it. Everything does.++++@++++Stop! Ow!
They're looting the mall. Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers!++++@++++I'm caught on something!
I don't want you looting!++++@++++But I was gonna loot you a present!
Well, look at the wonders of the computer age now.++++@++++Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?
I think that was implied by what I said.++++@++++Implied, Lisa? Or implode?
They're evacuating the Earth! We're saved!++++@++++Thank you, sweet clown.
I'm not dead!++++@++++I can still hear his voice on the wind.
There it is!++++@++++Just like the dead clown promised.
They must be starting a new civilization on Mars with our best and brightest.++++@++++That's us!
Name please.++++@++++Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie "Shine."
Uh-huh. And your name is?++++@++++Uh... Shiny McShine?
Love ya lots!++++@++++Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage.
Hey, look, another spaceship!++++@++++And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
Are you still talking about the Earth?++++@++++You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
Wait a minute. They're not so great.++++@++++Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?
Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth? I mean, my shows weren't great, but I never tied people up and forced 'em to watch. And I could've. 'Cause I'm a big guy. And I'm good with knots.++++@++++So we're all gonna die?
'Fraid so. But hey, the grub's pretty good, huh?++++@++++The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
Hey, turn those frowns around!++++@++++Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell.
Don't worry, Dad. We'll be dead in five minutes.++++@++++Not fast enough!
Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?++++@++++I have to go to ze lobby!
I'm sorry, but we're not supposed to put butter on the Milk Duds.++++@++++You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either.
TouchÃ©.++++@++++To the top please.
Your honor has been insulted! This will not stand.++++@++++Sh-sh-shh!
Are you crazy, dude?++++@++++I challenge you to a duel.
The dude is crazy!++++@++++Will you duel, or are you a coward?!
My hero!++++@++++Uh, uh. "H" is for Homer.
Yeah, thanks. It's just past the end of the bar, next to the heavyset guy.++++@++++Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?
All right, take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just saying you ain't no, uh, Tommy Tune.++++@++++No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor.
I-- Your what now?++++@++++I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.
Hey, a duel? I, ah-- Isn't that a little extreme? Here, here, have a free beer.++++@++++Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer.
Yeah, I ain't never been slapped with no duelin' glove before, either.++++@++++Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP...
Suh, your challenge is accepted.++++@++++Huh?
You'll need a will and headstone, aisle six.++++@++++Aisle six?
Yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you.++++@++++Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?
Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?++++@++++Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go.
Looks like you were saved by a Christmas tree.++++@++++And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
Oooh, yes indeedy, Homer. Looks like they're settling in for a long stay.++++@++++I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu...
To continue talking, please deposit ten cents.++++@++++Ah, screw it.
Where are we gonna live?++++@++++Ooh! How 'bout that house?
That has people living in it. You can see them through the windows.++++@++++Lousy show-offs.
Yeah, git yer own habitat.++++@++++Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.
Come back here! Why, you yellow belly...++++@++++Come on, move it!
Where are we going, Dad?++++@++++How should I know?
Then why are you driving so fast?++++@++++'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
You mean Grampa's old farm?++++@++++Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...
What a dump!++++@++++Race ya to the swimmin' hole!
Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons.++++@++++Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
Are we really gonna live here and grow crops?++++@++++Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
I'll repress the rage I'm feeling.++++@++++That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
It doesn't sound very tractor-y.++++@++++Hang on.
Well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy German car.++++@++++This car was made in Guatemala.
Well pardon us, Mr. Gucci loafers.++++@++++I bought these shoes from a hobo.
Well la-dee-da, Mr. Park-Avenue manicure.++++@++++I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming.
You're not gonna grow nothin' on the old Simpson place. That's why your daddy abandoned it.++++@++++Aw, what do you know?
Well, I know your soil pH is up around 9.6, and you need it seven to eight, max.++++@++++Oh, that's just superstition.
Wow, Dad, this is the juiciest watermelon I ever tasted.++++@++++Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.
What are you planting?++++@++++Oh, a little bit of everything.
Paw!++++@++++Move the handbrake...
Maybe it needs more fertilizer.++++@++++I'm only one man, Marge.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Salad Fork. You couldn't grow stink on a monkey.++++@++++Leave me alone, you big bully.
Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger.++++@++++Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out.
Wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?++++@++++Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow...
It's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?++++@++++Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
You got that from a movie poster!++++@++++Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope.
Where'd you get that?++++@++++From the producers of "Waiting to Exhale."
Is that plutonium on your gums?++++@++++Shut up and kiss me.
But it's only been one night.++++@++++That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from "The Amazing Colossal Man," and "Grasshopperus," it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast.
Yeah, but didn't Grasshopperus kill Chad Everett?++++@++++Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
Oh, honey, give it up.++++@++++Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn.
Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself.++++@++++This better be good.
Something's growing.++++@++++A sprout!
What is it? Carrots? Peas? Maybe it's okra.++++@++++Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!
Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.++++@++++Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants.
It does. But it's smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive.++++@++++Addictive, eh?
"ToMacco?" That's pretty clever, Dad. I mean, for a product that's evil and deadly.++++@++++Aw, thanks honey.
Excuse me, Mr. Farmer man. I promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and I... "ToMacco?"++++@++++Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?
I was here first! / C'mon, c'mon people!++++@++++Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
Don't forget your mincemeat pie!++++@++++You're scaring the customers, honey.
Hello, folks. Would you and your family like to take a ride with us?++++@++++Okay.
Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. Kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.++++@++++Those dirty rotten...
Tell me about it. But there's no law against selling kids tomacco. That little "M" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you.++++@++++How much?
... million dollars.++++@++++One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?
Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?++++@++++Oh, yeah. Let's take it.
You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant.++++@++++I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin.
Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.++++@++++I agree, but how?
Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.++++@++++Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...
Give them the plant, Homer!++++@++++No, I'd rather die!
Well! What a lovely gift. Gotta run!++++@++++So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?
I've never been so glad to be home.++++@++++I don't know why we ever left in the first place.
I don't mind if I do.++++@++++Hey, are we duellin' or what?
You okay, Dad?++++@++++I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.
Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for.++++@++++After pie.
Num num, Maggie. Num num.++++@++++Did somebody say num num?
I can't get Maggie to eat. Maybe if you try...++++@++++Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie.
All right, smart guy. Where's the fire?++++@++++Over there.
Turn around, Simpson.++++@++++No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
Hey Homer, what gives?++++@++++Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
Hey, you wanna come bowling with us tonight?++++@++++Okay.
Oh no, not Lenny. Not Lenny!++++@++++Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what I really want.
Poo. Uh, Homer, what wacky name do you want?++++@++++Are poo and ass taken?
Simpson! Even for a bowler, you're fat!++++@++++Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?
Uhh, actually, I'd say you're having a severe psychotic episode.++++@++++What a rotten day!
Hey, Homer. That's four strikes in a row. You got a perfect game going!++++@++++Really?
Ah, this split you sold me is making me choke.++++@++++Lenny...
Ho-mer! Ho-mer! Ho-mer!++++@++++Ow!
Now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. So we'll just stay here and not disturb him.++++@++++Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.
You did it, Homie!++++@++++In your face, to-do list!
Ho-mer! Ho-mer!++++@++++Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl.
Mr. Simpson bowled a perfect game without the aid of steroids, crack, angel dust, or the other narcotics that are synonymous with pro bowling.++++@++++Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection.
Will you be my Dad?++++@++++You've got a father. He's just a dud.
Do you think I could grow up to be a doctor?++++@++++Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?
Uhhh, Homer...++++@++++Yes, Kent?
According to Redbook Magazine, what is the speed of light?++++@++++Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled "Jokes" or "Answers?"
Make me center square, Kent! I'm ready. I can handle it.++++@++++Dream on, Drunky!
Ohh, we've got to stop putting these flavors of the month on.++++@++++Flavor of the month? Me?
Yeah, Homer, you can't just ride one accomplishment forever. Why do you think I stopped acting and became a director?++++@++++I 'unno... Because you weren't cute anymore?
Now to save my partner's life, I'll need complete...++++@++++Hello, everybody!
You idiot! You'll ruin everything!++++@++++I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?
Would you shut up?!++++@++++Hey, I thought you never talked.
He'll do it! I'm not the first Teller!++++@++++Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!
That's right! You are!++++@++++Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again.
Burt Reynolds, class act. Well now, for our segment, "Yesterday's News"... featuring Homer Simpson. Are you as bored as I am with the antics of this warmed-over Fred Flintstone? I say it's time to put this one-trick pony out to stud.++++@++++Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders.
Dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside.++++@++++Lisa, I know what's going on here. They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me.
Are you comparing yourself to our Lord?++++@++++Well, in bowling ability.
Ohhh, Homey, is that what's bothering you?++++@++++Mm-hmmm.
Well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.++++@++++You're right!
Geez, Homer. I never seen you so depressed. As your life partner, I'm very worried.++++@++++Save your tears, Moe. Save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope.
Hey, Mr. S. I didn't know you bungeed.++++@++++I wanna live!
No, no! You're too heavy!++++@++++It's a glandular problemmmm!
Well, except that.++++@++++Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind.
Oh, dumbass, trying to get yourself killed?++++@++++Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy.
Look, I'd love to help you out, Homer, but I'm taking my kids to the zoo.++++@++++That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
Daddy, we're missing the fantasti-potamus. She only sings twice a day!++++@++++That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.
Really? You have children? Oh, well look, here's some money.++++@++++No. I don't want your pity or your money.
Usually when you say that, you give the money back.++++@++++I do what now?
If you tie a string around your finger real tight, you can make it turn purple.++++@++++I can see I'm not needed here.
Mr. Simpson, you're going to be fine. Although you do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs.++++@++++Actually, that was before I went in the ocean.
Well, I don't want to pry into your personal life...++++@++++Then don't.
It's quite simple -- When a parent's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength.++++@++++Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on.
These Swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. I mean, a green table! I wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams.++++@++++And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
You put it together yourself. All you need is me, Allen Wrench.++++@++++He's named after what he is.
Oh! Manjula has begun to ovulate.++++@++++Yes, I will have the... Pl_penlÃ¼gen. And don't skimp on the D__dlemÃ¼nch.
Hello, Simpsons!++++@++++Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?
Oh, yes sir. Quite happily.++++@++++Pay up, Marge.
Mm. On the other hand, monkey see, monkey do!++++@++++Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all.
By chilling my loins, I increase the chances of impregnating my wife.++++@++++Whoa, too much information! Thanks for the mental picture. Why don't you tell us what you really think?
Just stop spouting those hackneyed quips.++++@++++Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream.
You know, Homer, you might want to open those cans before they explode.++++@++++But the cans seal in the flavor.
No, still no luck. Tell me, Homer, did you have to take any special steps when you decided to have children?++++@++++Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.
Well, not to us they don't. Oh Homer, we have tried everything! Oysters, gravity boots, Sanjay's bed, every possible position...++++@++++Really? On top and underneath?
Eh, yes.++++@++++Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas.
I'm willing to play the high school jock, but did you have to cut the roof off my car?++++@++++Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're "Greg."
"Loosen up, baby. Tomorrow I'm shipping off to Vietnam." I... I thought I was going to Ivy League State.++++@++++My mistake. Stay in the moment.
Just promise not to forget me on your dinosaur-bone-digging-up trip...++++@++++And that's my cue to exit.
You have octuplets. It rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.++++@++++Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies.
Mm-hmm. Well, that would only account for quintuplets. Did anyone else slip this woman fertility drugs?++++@++++Mine tasted like strawberry.
Gee, sorry for being born.++++@++++I've been waiting so long to hear that.
You know, I saw Apu today. He's really frazzled.++++@++++Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.
Apu told me all eight babies have colic. Although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.++++@++++Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?
Yes, dear. From the nuclear plant.++++@++++Beautiful.
Knock, knock!++++@++++Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this.
Oh look who's here, the family with one baby. How do you manage?++++@++++Marge... They've turned into jerks.
Let's hear it for Dazzle!++++@++++She's no Liza, but it works.
She's waking up!++++@++++Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
It's not just you prancin' around in a monkey suit, is it?++++@++++Not any more!
We'll do our best, Chutney-Butt.++++@++++Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!
When we come back, we'll show you the contents of a supermodel's stomach!++++@++++What an age we live in.
Hey, remember the fifties? Remember television, Coca-Cola, and Dick Clark?++++@++++I remember television!
Why don't we eat there tonight?!++++@++++Nah. We'll go next month.
It's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.++++@++++Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine.
Dad, they have those everywhere.++++@++++What an age we live in.
Dancing!++++@++++Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will.
Our grand prize tonight is a vintage 1955 Harley-Davidson motorcycle.++++@++++That's right, never!
Well, well, well, I've never seen such reckless disregard for a wife's well-being in my life. You've just won yourselves a motorcycle!++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, Dad. Why don't you just take it for a ride?++++@++++Promise you won't laugh?
Yeah, I promise.++++@++++I don't know how.
Yeah, you can arrest me, but you'll never defeat the Cobras. Nothing can defeat a motorcycle gang.++++@++++A gang! That's the answer.
Sweet hog, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Remember to rebel against authority, kids.
Will you turn that engine off?++++@++++Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep.
Look what you've done! You've ruined the display!++++@++++Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers.
Never, pops.++++@++++Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.
Hey, Homer! Can I join?++++@++++This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos.
The Chri... I-I-I don't think you understand my objection...++++@++++I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets.
Hell's Satans, huh? I'm watchin' you punks.++++@++++Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink.
You'll make a mistake some day. And then you're going straight to juvie.++++@++++You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras.
Cobras? I thought you were the Hell's Satans.++++@++++Oink! Oink! Oink!
Get away from my store, you young hoodlums.++++@++++And what if we don't, Pops?
You took a picture of me when I was asleep?++++@++++If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.
We're the Hell's Satans, out of Bakersfield.++++@++++You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...
Take off that jacket, man.++++@++++Okay.
Now eat it.++++@++++All right.
Hey, hey, chew with your mouth closed, please.++++@++++Sorry.
You got anything else with our logo on it?++++@++++Caps and frisbees, sir.
You gotta eat them, too.++++@++++And some pogs.
Yeah, it's part of being a lowlife.++++@++++Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter...
Forget it, Simpson. Those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as I do.++++@++++But you have so much inner beauty.
Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner!++++@++++You're done. Next!
No, we're not.++++@++++Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!
And why aren't I at school?++++@++++Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!
Dad, there's a note on the back of your head.++++@++++Really? Read it.
Hm. "Thanks for letting us crash in your pad. We had a very nice time."++++@++++Oh, that's sweet.
Korean Love Brides?!++++@++++I just don't want to be alone.
Yeah, I did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. Said they were gonna spend the night at Crystal Lake Campground, Section K, Space 217. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.++++@++++I guess I'll never find her.
Homer, Homer, stop it! We've given up our violent ways. We just want to live peacefully, with your wife.++++@++++No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!++++@++++Uh-oh.
We both knew it would come to this.++++@++++You and me, chopper to chopper.
Take your wallet.++++@++++Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!
Hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in San Berdoo?++++@++++Whaddaya say, honey?
Why are we stopping here?++++@++++Taking care of some unfinished business.
Sis-ters are doin' it for themselves!++++@++++Hey, why is this door locked?
Uh, we're drunk. Really drunk!++++@++++Oh, thank God.
What will become of our kids?++++@++++Where are the refreshments?
I've got a motorhome I never use. Maybe we should raffle it off.++++@++++Maybe you should shut up.
What about Mr. Burns? Maybe he'll help us out.++++@++++Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds.
Check it out. I'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.++++@++++Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books.
This broom closet is not what it seems. It's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot.++++@++++Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa?
Thus saving Christmas.++++@++++Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw...
Yes. The madness ends here.++++@++++Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that...
Well, what do we have here? Looks like the biggest rip-off since "Webster."++++@++++Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain.
No, Bart, he's right. I did oversimplify.++++@++++Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.
Well, there's something you don't see every Christmas.++++@++++Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home.
Hey, Dad... What if we...++++@++++Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us?
Cloning is a troubling issue.++++@++++I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
Well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the...++++@++++Get her! She's doing something!
She cleaned out the attic!++++@++++Our junk!
/ Push! /++++@++++Come on!
I'll never get rid of this useless junk.++++@++++Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!
Look at these. You bought them after the Nagano Olympics, and never skied once. If you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe...++++@++++Hey, let's go skiing right now!
Yeah! Let's go skiing! / Yeah, Dad. Let's go!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Look Dad, it's the drummer from Bread!++++@++++Where?!
I'm sorry!++++@++++Hmmm... "The Widowmaker," Oh, that one's for the ladies. "Spinebuster," boring. Ooh, "Colostomizer."
Hi-didly-ho, Schuss in Boots.++++@++++Flanders!
Feels like I'm wearing nothin' at all!++++@++++Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--
Feels like I'm wearin' nothin' at all. Nothin' at all, nothin' at all...++++@++++Stupid sexy Flanders!
Have you been in here all day?++++@++++You missed all the fun.
That oughta hold it.++++@++++I want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
I can't be in the hospital! Tomorrow is laundry day. And I've gotta de-meat Lisa's baloney.++++@++++We'll be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better.
No they won't. We'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? Guys...?++++@++++Take that! Woo! Woo! H-Hey! Hey!
Oh, really? Well, knock yourself out. Just don't expect any miracles from those two.++++@++++Gotcha! Gotcha! / I'll show you!
Good Lord! You're wasting thousands of dollars worth of Interferon.++++@++++And you're "interferon" with our good time!
Dad, where are your clothes?++++@++++I don't know.
Don't tell me Mom dresses you.++++@++++I guess, or one of her friends.
Okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat.++++@++++Come on, "bikini inspector!" "Scrub toilet?" Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. "Feed fish."
You know, the reason for the hat...++++@++++Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat.
Will you at least do the dishes?++++@++++Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!
Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.++++@++++Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets.
You're dead, squealer.++++@++++Lisa, help!
No it's not!++++@++++I got the groceries!
Good. Maple soda?... A cell phone full of candy?... Astronaut bread?++++@++++It's the bread of astronauts.
Dad, I gave you a list!++++@++++Oh yeah. You were way off.
Oh, couldn't be better.++++@++++Marco!
Polo!++++@++++Marco!
Will you guys turn that thing down?++++@++++Sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? He hit her again.
Will this do?++++@++++Jesus?
Ohh, I don't like the looks of this.++++@++++You don't? 'Cause that's what I said! Tell her, Bart.
Let's see... Crusty sores...++++@++++Yes...
... Horrible wailing...++++@++++Yes! Yesssss!
Aahhh! Unclean! Unclean!++++@++++Help us, Virtual Doc! Look at me! I'm on my knees!
Now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. I'll get you a couple of mops.++++@++++Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.
Yeah, that sounds right.++++@++++Well, I think we're on the outs with Him, but I know someone who's even holier than Jesus.
Brains... Brains...++++@++++Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.
Oh, those poor souls. What's the Christian thing to do?++++@++++Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!
All right, food!++++@++++Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!
Uh, listen, Homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers.++++@++++So you're shunning us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you.++++@++++Oh, thank you good sir.
Whoa! This is a hospital?++++@++++That it is. We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married.
Ah, you must be the Simpsons.++++@++++Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.
Oh, you'll have a great view of the whole beach... from the electric needle room.++++@++++Really? The whole beach?
Yes, from the electric needle room.++++@++++Electric needle room?!
Yeah, we know.++++@++++I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.
No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.++++@++++This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing.
Well, it all sounds lovely, but...++++@++++Come on, loosen up. This is paradise.
Number one, report to the Dermabrasion Hut.++++@++++That's me!
Dad, you only took one course.++++@++++Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw? She used to call me "Preppy." Then she died.
There's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party...++++@++++Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.
You went to Springfield U. You hate A & M.++++@++++So much.
Or a ski hat if you've got a picture of a girl.++++@++++My old roommates, the nerds. Ya workin'?
Does anybody need that much porno?++++@++++One million times...
All right now, let's empty our pockets.++++@++++Make me.
Professor Rocco, Chancellor Knuckles?++++@++++Okay. All right. Okay.
We look like slobs.++++@++++I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
My computer has 512 shades of red.++++@++++Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...
Good evening, gentlemen.++++@++++Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!
I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.++++@++++Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, there's no such thing.
Sorry, but these guys crack me up.++++@++++What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
Okay. Hang on, Homer. Two eye holes coming up!++++@++++Easy... easy...
Homer, maybe I should drive.++++@++++What? I can see fine.
Wow! Is there anything he can't do?++++@++++Cure me! Cure me!
Brother, I sense you are feeling trapped and desperate.++++@++++Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!
I have the power!++++@++++I see the light! It burns!
What have you got so far?++++@++++Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
That's nice, but maybe your Homecoming float should have something to do with college.++++@++++Yeah, you're right.
I think Godzilla's bigger than Superman.++++@++++It's not to scale.
No, really. It can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles.++++@++++And chili fries!
Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers.++++@++++Can't make a float without flowers.
Oh-ho, true enough. But, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?++++@++++Yeah.
My thesaurus... You'll lose more than that. In preparation for the big game, Springfield Stadium has caught additional-seating-capacity fever.++++@++++Woo hoo! Go S.U.!
A & M is gonna kick your ivy-covered butts!++++@++++Yeah, well you went to a cow college!
Whoa Nelly, we have ourselves a barnburner here today! Welcome to the 117th dust-up between the Snortin' Swine of Springfield A & M and the Springfield University Nittany Tide. Ohhh, doctor! Break out the hickory switch!++++@++++Okay, who needs another lamb rack?
Do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?++++@++++Well, I think the veal might have died of loneliness...
Wow! He should have his foot insured by Lloyds of London!++++@++++Oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, Marge?
Now, ladies and gentlemen, pour a little cider on those peepers, 'cause here comes the half-time parade!++++@++++I forgot my float!
And as those lumbering ships of the gridiron sail off into our memories, the players return to the field.++++@++++Wait! Hang on!
Then, what's this?++++@++++Wait! Wait! I got a float too! Listen up, 'cause I gotta explain a lot of it!
Hey, look out! / Look out!++++@++++Out of the way, Baryshnikov!
Just a simple yes or no.++++@++++Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.
I wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar-athlete.++++@++++No, wait! I got a kid who's a miracle worker! He'll heal him up real good.
Well he'd better, or else!++++@++++Or else what?
Sorry, Dad. I can't just magically cure a broken leg.++++@++++Please, Bart. You've gotta use your powers! I'm beggin' ya!
I know, is phony major. Lubchenko learn nothing. Nothing!++++@++++Bart, do your thing!
Springfield Community!++++@++++This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great.
Hey hey!++++@++++Wha...?!
Seat filler.++++@++++Everyone gets an award but me.
I can't help it if I donated the most blood. Oh, I'm feeling kinda woozy.++++@++++Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
You won a Grammy.++++@++++I mean an award that's worth winning.
Homer, sit down.++++@++++What's that, sonny?
"Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..." I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over.++++@++++Well, that was a great night for us all.
That's not an award, that's part of the set.++++@++++Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
Don't worry about a thing. We'll take good care of your house!++++@++++Look at me, I'm a billionaire!
Good Lord! This bedroom is as big as our house!++++@++++And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
Seems a little wasteful.++++@++++Wasteful AND practical.
I'm Princess Margaret!++++@++++I'm drunk!
Mom! Bart's making faces at me. I think.++++@++++Look how loud I have to yell!
Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?++++@++++Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.
Stop that! Cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like Bill Crosby and David Letterson.++++@++++Oops, forgot to swirl it.
Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?++++@++++Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits.
Stop swirling, Homer!++++@++++Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody.
Homer, who are you calling?++++@++++Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I...
Well, don't run up Mr. Burns' phone bill.++++@++++Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?
Homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. You're not a billionaire.++++@++++Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge.
All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.++++@++++Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party.
Party? No! No parties.++++@++++What about partays?
No partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials...++++@++++Damn!
How 'bout Tuborg? The beer of Danish Kings.++++@++++Mmmm, Danish.
Now, you know I can't sell you no beer till two P.M., on accounta it's Sunday.++++@++++Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?
When it gets to here, we can drink again.++++@++++But I need that beer now.
Sorry. Two P.M. Or you can steal a boat and sail out to International Waters.++++@++++What's that, a theme park?
No, the ocean. Once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. That's where they held the Tyson/Secretariat fight.++++@++++They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!
Oh no, you don't! I'm not going to let you trash Mr. Burns' yacht.++++@++++Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire.
Hey, there's another way to get on the boat!++++@++++Woo hoo!
The boat's going sideways!++++@++++Ships ahoy!
Wow, you can do anything out here.++++@++++That's right. See that ship over there?
Please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. Yarrr.++++@++++There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!
Well, let's play it by ear.++++@++++Pirates! Are you friendly pirates?
Uh, not really, no.++++@++++What have you done with my party guests?
Aye aye, captain.++++@++++Help, pirates!
Navy Seals are on the way.++++@++++Oh, bless you!
How 'bout a tactical nuclear strike?++++@++++Oh, that would be just... You're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?
Enough! Get in the net.++++@++++I don't wanna!
Some party, Homer.++++@++++Shut up, Net Face.
Hey, you're in the net, too.++++@++++I said shut up, Net Face!
And now we will cut you loose. For liability purposes it is the ocean that will kill you, not us.++++@++++Ahhhh!
Hey, what do you know? It floats.++++@++++That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.
What about the people on the bottom?++++@++++They're the greatest heroes of all. Hey, something's clawing at my leg. Okay, it stopped.
... yes, not bad.++++@++++Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht.
Ah, it's good to be home.++++@++++I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.
Bart, stop that! Now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here.++++@++++That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!
Do you have a military I.D.?++++@++++I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho.
Homer, give him the fifty cents.++++@++++Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and...
Just go.++++@++++Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.
Who are those pleasant old men?++++@++++It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was "T.C.B." That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare.
But first we'd like to dip into our new CD...++++@++++Takin' Care of Business!
Don't worry, sir. We'll get to that one...++++@++++No talking! No new crap! "Takin' Care of Business!" Now!
YOU GET UP EVERY MORNING / TO THE ALARM CLOCK's WARNING / TAKE THE EIGHT-FIFTEEN INTO THE CITY...++++@++++Get to the "workin' overtime" part!
Workin' overtime...++++@++++Work out!
We just did!++++@++++What-everrr!
Homer, Lisa's in that.++++@++++I stand by my disappointed groan.
I can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.++++@++++Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo.
Zing!++++@++++See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt.
Excuse me. But I believe this family already had a horse, and the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart with hilarious consequences.++++@++++Anybody care what this guy thinks?
Oh, my. Ooh-hoo. It's going to cost us $500 a week to keep Duncan!++++@++++But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws.
At least you don't have to feed any of the stuff I bought at the fair. Well, except the mop.++++@++++Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep.
He's a diving horse. Maybe he could dive for pearls.++++@++++Pearls, eh?
Hey, Dad.++++@++++Huh?
This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.++++@++++Racehorse, eh?
Dad, if we're gonna race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?++++@++++Son, I learned everything I needed to know from "The Horse Whisperer". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife.
Really? I thought I was the only one.++++@++++Champion horse, coming through!
You mean horseshoes?++++@++++Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies.
You really think that horse can run a mile and a half?++++@++++He ran all the way here.
Duncan's really fast, Dad. He was just intimidated by those other horses.++++@++++Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies.
Is that Duncan?++++@++++Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to...
Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!++++@++++Possessions are fleeting.
You're quite a trainer, Mr. Simpson. Care to join us for a beer in the Jockey's Lounge?++++@++++I've been waiting all my life to hear that.
These are our real voices! We only talk like this on your surface world.++++@++++But you're respected athletes! You own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
YOUR RENEGADE HORSE IS MAKING US FROWN!++++@++++What do you want me to do?
YOUR HORSE MUST LOSE!++++@++++MY HORSE MUST LOSE?
JUST LOSE THE STINKIN' RACE!++++@++++AND WHAT IF I REFUSE TO LOSE?
We'll eat your brain.++++@++++MY HORSE MUST LOSE!
You want me to lose the Springfield Derby? But you always taught me that winning was everything.++++@++++Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard.
Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud.++++@++++Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls.
Might this be the start of a terrifying Planet of the Horses? In this announcer's opinion, almost certainly yes. And away I go.++++@++++Go, son! Do it for the normals!
Hey, need any help, Homer?++++@++++Nah, we're cool.
We'll give you gold!++++@++++Now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies.
Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. Everything we pack in, we pack out.++++@++++But what if I have to do my business?
Use this plastic bag.++++@++++How come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?
Ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to Springfield.++++@++++Bees!
They sound angry... and Africanized.++++@++++Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me.
The Bird Sanctuary -- they ruined it!++++@++++No they didn't. They just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit.
Show us your boobs, show us your boobs.++++@++++Better do what he says, Marge.
That's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned.++++@++++We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.
Hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!++++@++++Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?
C'mon! Somebody crash!++++@++++Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes.
Eight seconds! Great job, boys!++++@++++Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!
We're going as fast as we can, ma -- Hey, who are you?++++@++++Oh, how rude of me. My name is...
And now, here's something for the guys...++++@++++Finally!
Well, I guess no one else wants a T-shirt!++++@++++That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!
You heard him, girls.++++@++++Hey, T-shirt- T-shirt-T-shirt!
Fire!++++@++++Oooh, a bobby pin.
No, I really mean it, though. I mean if it was you that died, I would have been on her so fast...++++@++++And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Well, from now on I'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much I love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt. Yeah, that works.
Now Homey, you know, Ned and the boys need us. And you know what that means.++++@++++I know. No more being a jerk.
And now, the good people at Fan-Demonium, as part of a generous settlement, will fire a 21-T-shirt salute.++++@++++Finally.
Now if there's anything, anything at all I can do to help out...++++@++++Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.
That's nice of you Homer, but I think I'll just go to bed.++++@++++Then I insist on walking you home.
Homer, this really isn't necessary...++++@++++Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler.
Hey, that's my sprinkler.++++@++++It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. It's time to let go.
I just bought that...++++@++++I know, I know. It's never easy.
Aw, Homer. You don't have to...++++@++++Sleep tight, Neddie.
No, Homer! I just need to talk.++++@++++Okay, be right down.
I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. I can't believe my last words to Maude were "No foot-longs."++++@++++Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said "I love you," or "you're special." You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack.
If I'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here.++++@++++Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation...
Ah, you're right. I've just got to work through the grief. There's not gonna be an easy answer.++++@++++Easy answer, eh?
Why are you taping Flanders, Dad?++++@++++You'll see...
Do you even have a job anymore?++++@++++I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.
Okay, I finished the gardening sequence.++++@++++Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills...
Dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes.++++@++++Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
Oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but I feel like I've turned a corner.++++@++++Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape...
Tape?++++@++++Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy.
Is this a dating video?++++@++++Shush.
So that's why you maced me.++++@++++Yeah.
Oh I would date Ned in a second, if I was a woman, or gay. He looks like a cuddler, that Ned. I, I like that. I like to be held. I like to be pampered.++++@++++So if you're tired of dating the same old losers...
What are you doing, Homer?++++@++++...Step up to the best. Ned Flanders, the man with the chest.
Ewwww.++++@++++Now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! The healing begins.
Homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? It just feels way too soon.++++@++++Oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?
Got it.++++@++++Beautiful! And star-wipe, aaaand we're out.
Homer, I'm having second thoughts. This feels so disloyal to Maude.++++@++++Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?
You think she would?++++@++++How could she not? The place is full of eligible bachelors -- John Wayne, Tupac Shakur, Sherlock Holmes...
Sherlock Holmes is a character.++++@++++He sure is!
You're darn right you are! And you've got lots of other great qualities, too.++++@++++That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you.
What floozies? What are you talking...++++@++++Marge, we're trying to help Ned.
Homer, you help too.++++@++++I toileth not on ye Sabbath, woman! A pox on thee.
You're watching PBS?!++++@++++Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com.
Do Shut Up?++++@++++It's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker.
Me eyes! / Oh, I'm scalded, I am!++++@++++The Mother's the voice of reason.
Classic. Not hard to see why it's England's longest-running series. And today, we're showing all seven episodes.++++@++++Hey, what the hell's going on?!
Sorry, but these thieves make me so damn mad! You know who you are. Thieves!++++@++++You're mad? Where's my show!?
And now, it's time to go back to "Do Shut Up."++++@++++Finally.
Outstanding.++++@++++Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.
You know, I've worked with so many legendary actors over the years who could be counted on to "phone it in". Well, now it's your turn to phone it in -- your pledge, that is. Please, please, we're only ten thousand dollars away from returning to our show.++++@++++Well, why didn't you say so?
Dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars.++++@++++Eh, how're they gonna find me?
But, thanks to Insta-trace, we've learned it's Homer Simpson, of 742 Evergreen Terrace.++++@++++Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?
Our pledge-enforcement van will be at his house in moments.++++@++++Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart.
They don't show police chases, do they?++++@++++Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary.
Well said, Homer. And now, for the moment of generosity...++++@++++Will cash be okay?
It's 12:15.++++@++++Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open.
Get in there.++++@++++I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please.
You are on television. Please play along. Are you robbing me?++++@++++I'll pay you later.
Um... Is there a problem, Mr. Simpson?++++@++++Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just...
You don't have the money, do you Homer?++++@++++Mm-mm.
And you thought you could stab your problems away?++++@++++Mm-hmm.
Silly goose. Why didn't you say so? Get 'im, boys.++++@++++The Hooligans!
Oh, why did I teach him that word?++++@++++Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!
Ellmeaux knows where you live.++++@++++Please help me! I'll do anything! I'll light a candle! I'll help with your next charity scam!
The word is "drive."++++@++++Sure, sure, Bob's your uncle. Let's just get outta here!
We'll send you someplace safe till the heat dies down.++++@++++Great, but why am I on a plane?
Homer, how would you like to be a missionary in the South Pacific?++++@++++South Pacific?! I didn't agree to...
Sorry, no can do.++++@++++Oh, save me Jebus!
No, no. You can even keep in touch with him on this ham radio.++++@++++Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!
You must be Homer! I'm Craig, that's Amy. Well, see ya.++++@++++You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?
First of all, forget everything you learned in missionary school.++++@++++Done.
Don't let the bed bugs bite. Seriously.++++@++++Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.
Welcome, Reverend Homer. We look forward to learning about the Bible from you.++++@++++Here you go. Knock yourself out.
We can not read.++++@++++Does the word "jet-lag" mean anything to you people? "Jet-laggg".
Are you enjoying your ox testicle?++++@++++Oh, yes. Very much so.
Really? You sure you wouldn't rather have a coconut? They're delicious.++++@++++No, I'm good.
Oh, we call that . Sorry, fish bone in my throat. We call that "earthquake."++++@++++Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.
I am Oovilu-eeoo-kitana-wanjay.++++@++++I'm gonna call you Lisa Junior. So, what do you do for fun around here?
Craig and Amy were also building a chapel.++++@++++Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?
I told you we should have asked them.++++@++++So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?
T...V?++++@++++You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?
Cou-ouch?++++@++++No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!++++@++++Nothin'.
Hello? Is there anybody in there?++++@++++Marge!
Homer, are you all right?++++@++++I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough.
You've only been gone two days.++++@++++Really? Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.
I just don't think it's funny!++++@++++Mmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: Bart, you're the man of the house. Lisa -- I'm promoting you to boy. Maggie's now the brainy girl. The toaster can fill in for Maggie. And Marge, you're a consultant.
I just want to tell you how proud I am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.++++@++++Really? You're proud of me?
Oh, yes. The whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. Ned Flanders is green with envy.++++@++++Oh, really? Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...
Dad, are you licking toads?++++@++++Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!++++@++++Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger.
Amy said there are lots of religions. Which is the right one?++++@++++Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat.
Um, if the Lord is all powerful, why does he care whether we worship him or not? Ak just saying...++++@++++Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock.
Ooh, tell us all you know about nuclear power.++++@++++Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I am Ak.++++@++++Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!
The Lucky Savage?++++@++++It could be you!
Number six.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, I'm so impressed. Everything you're doing sounds so rewarding.++++@++++Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels.
How can ace be one and eleven? Huh? What kind of God would allow that?++++@++++Oh, what happened?! I gave you a glittering Vegas, and you turned it into a skanky Atlantic City!
Why are you building chapel?++++@++++Because you're all terrible sinners.
No, really.++++@++++Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume.
Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!++++@++++Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!
You set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?++++@++++I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.
Now, which one of you is our designated driver?++++@++++Twist off, dammit!
Okay, our first event qualifies for course credit at Dartmouth College -- trick pouring!++++@++++Go Moe! Boo everyone else!
Don't forget, today's winner will be immortalized on our new Duff Calendar.++++@++++All right, guys. One, two, three.
When I get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.++++@++++That one.
Those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. And if Bart gets a wowwipop, I want a wowwipop.++++@++++Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in.
Oh, boy!++++@++++Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!
I can't believe they put those stickers over my face. I must be the ugliest man alive.++++@++++Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle?
The little rat eyes...++++@++++Caveman brow...
Or be with.++++@++++C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight.
Beautiful.++++@++++Okay, now do Moe.
So this is all real?++++@++++Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today.
Yeah, hello yourself. I'm Moe Szyslak. Back in high school, I asked you to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance, and you turned me down. Well, I just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'.++++@++++Yeah!
Apology? Uh, geez, I wasn't expecting that... uh...++++@++++Run!
Okay, last stop. Channel 6.++++@++++You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
Homer, whoa, whoa, Homer. Change of plans.++++@++++Whatever.
Hey, there are women in our bar!++++@++++Hey, Moe. Beer me!
Ah, I'm a little busy, Homer. Ah, you can pour it yourself.++++@++++Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.
I didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.++++@++++You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion.
I've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. But the one hole I've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.++++@++++That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on.
Yeah, hey, I gotta gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching. And I... the feeling is indescribable.++++@++++I know what you mean. Our dog had that.
Hmm. Looks like my character gets back together with that evil Contessa.++++@++++The one with the amulet?
Precisely. Then I get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow!++++@++++What? Let me see that! "Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'" Yep, that does sound kinda bad.
Well, how could I say no to such a captivating...++++@++++Ding-dong!
Whoa, it's the door.++++@++++Dr. Winslooooow...
Why, who are you?++++@++++I am an angel from the future.
And what do you have to tell us, oh, Angel of the Future?++++@++++You're going to die in a skydiving accident.
How tragic. Tell me more.++++@++++Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results.
Ooh, that's unexpected. What else?++++@++++Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results.
Stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!++++@++++Yeah!
Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters...++++@++++Yeah, you were...
Folks, you're gonna want to turn around. The bugs are firmly in charge.++++@++++What?
Please, just go! They've taken the Visitors' Center! They, they ate the comment book!++++@++++All right! Geez...
Hey, an Indian casino!++++@++++God bless Native America.
Homer, you know I had a gambling problem.++++@++++Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? Lisa?
Ah, something troubles me about Indian gaming. On the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes...++++@++++Sure we can't talk you into it?
Yeah, but I really wanna...++++@++++Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian.
Yo, it's me.++++@++++Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!
Don't you mean present?++++@++++Right, right, present. Anyway, can I get you some Soylent Green?
Isn't that made of people?++++@++++Oh, here we go.
Hey, Dad. My band finally got a break. I just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. How about a little loanski?++++@++++Oh, I'm tired of giving you money. Why can't you be more like Lisa?
But I want some.++++@++++You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.
What happened to you, man? You used to be cool.++++@++++I'm still cool.
Nah, you've changed, man.++++@++++Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. Oh, you can.
Don't you think we should wait for Lisa? She is the President.++++@++++She knows what time dinner is.
Dad, that's just a myth. Lincoln didn't hide any gold in the White House.++++@++++Then what is his ghost protecting?
Wait! How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the gold? You just started counting from an arbitrary place.++++@++++I started what from a what?
Your plan makes no sense.++++@++++Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see...
Gold bars discovered by Homer?++++@++++Shut up.
"Dear Countryman: You have come in search of my gold, and I will not disappoint you."++++@++++Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...
My gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving American.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10++++@++++Ah, crap!
It's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..." Well, isn't that clever? It's a metaphor.++++@++++That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!
I can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.++++@++++Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice.
He'll pay a lot to get this back.++++@++++Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
Dad, that's a sports bra.++++@++++All I know is, I'm finally getting the support I need.
Ooo, Italian.++++@++++Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job.
Gee, is that what I look like when I'm drunk?++++@++++Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out!
Behold, I am King Talkie-Tiki!++++@++++Hey Flanders? Can your God do that?
Do not anger Talkie-Tiki! I am all-power--++++@++++I'll be at Moe's.
What are you, nuts?++++@++++I threw you a party at my house.
Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me.++++@++++You wish. That's the stage we call "Professor Barney" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. Here's drunk.
Well, I'm off to market...++++@++++Marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... Oh, it's just Barney.
Oh, I'm a disgrace.++++@++++Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents.
I'll show you. I'm gonna take these helicopter lessons.++++@++++Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car.
Santeria, you're the greatest!++++@++++Barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?
I know, but it's so hard. Please help me, Homer.++++@++++You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.
I feel for you, pally. But, uh, you want A.A. -- this is triple A.++++@++++Oh. My name is Homer and I'm planning a trip to St. Louis.
East St. Louis?++++@++++Is there any other St. Louis?
Ah, welcome back, Homer. I see you've finally hit rock bottom.++++@++++Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney.
Well, your recovery begins today. And we promise you all the sugar cookies and second-hand smoke you can handle.++++@++++The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?
They're on that table over there.++++@++++I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.
Hey, Homer. Ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. Take this seat, right next to the tap.++++@++++But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?
Yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging.++++@++++Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney!
See, Homer? It's not so bad. Now dance, rummy!++++@++++Okay...
You danced for hours just because they told you to?++++@++++If I didn't, I'd lose their respect.
Wanna go for a ride?++++@++++Can I, Marge? Can I?
Whoops, sorry. When I think about all the time I wasted at Moe's...++++@++++Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker?
Those are all priceless memories, Homer, but I don't want to do that stuff anymore.++++@++++Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?
Oh, don't be that way, Homer.++++@++++I'll scream.
So how was your ride with Barney?++++@++++I don't wanna talk about it!
Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years.++++@++++But you've got me. Who have I got?
Well, you still have Lenny and Carl.++++@++++Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends...
Well, if Barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. Old friends stick together, like O.J. and A.C., or the Falcon and the Snowman.++++@++++Oh, why can't I have a nickname?
Oh, hello Homer.++++@++++Barney.
Beer, huh?++++@++++That's right.
Enjoy.++++@++++That I will.
Then we agree.++++@++++You keep thinkin' that.
Good day, then.++++@++++Good day, then is right.
Ta.++++@++++Ta-ta.
Now dance, rummy!++++@++++Okay.
Hiya, Moe.++++@++++Well, if it isn't Little Miss "I'm not wasting my life anymore." Which he is.
Fire has broken out on Mount Springfield, trapping two youngsters and their camera.++++@++++Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!
I can't. I've never flown solo!++++@++++Barney...
I know, I know! I haven't learned right turns yet.++++@++++Look out!
Beer. That's what I need.++++@++++Barney, no! Don't!
Yes! I need it!++++@++++No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
You can't drink 'em all.++++@++++Oh, yes I can!
You brave man. You took six silver bullets for me.++++@++++Stay away from my wife!
Hang on! I'll throw you a ladder!++++@++++Get off! Get off!
Dad, help!++++@++++All right, I'm comin'.
You did it, Dad!++++@++++You can't prove I did it.
No, you saved our lives.++++@++++I could do a lotta things if I had some money.
Well, I'm glad we're friends again.++++@++++Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?
A double tall mocha latte.++++@++++It's not bad.
Here's the mail, Dad. That'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery.++++@++++...And three makes three.
This isn't real money. It's printed by the Montana Militia.++++@++++It'll be real soon enough.
I'm betting it's hunger and rage.++++@++++Yeah, but in what ratio?
Dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. You're supposed to open the magazine.++++@++++My way is easier.
Why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?++++@++++Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly.
Well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away.++++@++++No way. When?
Six months ago. You were at the funeral. You fell into the grave.++++@++++Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!
No, no, no, Nick. He's so good to his mother.++++@++++According to this you're both idiots.
Homie, for God's sakes, it's two a.m.++++@++++Fine. I'll take the next quiz. "How Long Will You Live?"
I don't know. I'm trying to sleep.++++@++++Okay, non-smoker... add eight years. So according to this I'll live to be... 42! Oh, that's horrible! I won't even live to see my children die!
Now what's wrong?++++@++++I've only got three more years to live!
Well, maybe you added it wrong. Let me add it...++++@++++See?! And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge. They're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business.
Oh, honey, don't panic. If you just made a few lifestyle changes...++++@++++No!
Maybe you should see a doctor, Homie. A head doctor.++++@++++I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy. Aren't you, TV?
The crisis? Charlie Bluhdorn's birthday. The solution? A snappy banner. Out comes the phone, in flies Bobby Towne. And six drafts later, I had myself a party.++++@++++You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.
Well, we've got a Soloflex down at H.Q. Anyway, everything looks great, Mr. Burns. I can't find a single violation or employee acting strangely.++++@++++You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.
Of course not. He's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. B... Oh, God! What's he doing?++++@++++A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?
You hate your father, don't you?++++@++++Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.
I shouldn't have brought that up. I was just venting. Anyhoo, I think your fear of death is causing your insomnia, which is provoking your erratic behavior.++++@++++Why isn't my baby gaining weight?
Because it's made of plastic.++++@++++I see...
What you need is a good, long rest. I suggest Florida.++++@++++Florida? But that's America's wang.
Quiet, you two! You know your father's had a breakdown.++++@++++My pockets hurt.
We got Kid Rock comin' up for all you mosh monkeys.++++@++++Wooo! I like mu-sic!
Yo, yo, straight out of Detroit, y'all, it's the J-O-E to the C! Let's rock the party with Kid Rock!++++@++++Oh, no, it's a lost child! Don't worry, folks. I'll tackle him.
MY NAME IS KIIIIDDDD KID ROCK!++++@++++BAWITDABA / BANANA FANA / OOGA CHOCKA / ETC.
Thank you! It's the pimp of the nation, Kid Rock, tearin' it up at Spring Break, y'all! Now, what we'd like to do next is bring it down for a minute.++++@++++Bring on the rappin' granny!
But this ain't no forty-ounce curb. So, we're gonna need forty gallons, y'all!++++@++++All for Homer... All for Homer...
Yo, let's waste that biatch!++++@++++Biatch? Moi?
No, sir... Please don't tell Mama.++++@++++They called you a pig, Sheriff.
Oh, thank goodness. Where were you?++++@++++Guess how many boobs I saw today, Marge? Fifteen!
Nah, boys will be boys. I reckon he was just blowin' off a little steam.++++@++++Doesn't he talk funny?
The world looks to us -- the college students -- for leadership.++++@++++Fine. Be nerds. I'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
Dad, look out!++++@++++LOOK OUT FOR WHAT?
THE GI-ANT GATOR!++++@++++THE GI-ANT...
You killed Captain Jack! You in a heap o' trouble, son.++++@++++You'll have to catch me first.
Well don't you worry, darlin'. I got some baby-cuffs in the station.++++@++++Look. This is our chance.
You can't drive, Dad. He's got your license.++++@++++Well, I'm gonna try anyway.
Pull over!++++@++++There's no good place!
There's lots of good places! What about over there?++++@++++No shade!
Homer no. You'll kill us all.++++@++++Or die trying...
Dad, what do we do?!++++@++++The only thing we can do. Sit tight, and try to get some sleep.
Hey, where is Dad?++++@++++Rise and shine, everybody.
You went to the snack car?++++@++++Yeah, but first I talked to the engineer. He said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature.
This family has hit a new low. We're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... And it's all your fault.++++@++++I love being married.
A diner!?++++@++++That's perfect! We can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
I like your honesty. You're hired. And you two haven't said a word. I like that. You're hired.++++@++++Woo hoo!
No thanks.++++@++++More hashbrowns, sugar?
Stop that.++++@++++But I was just...
Scat.++++@++++...gonna try to...
Go on now.++++@++++...knock you out...
Too hot to bicker, I reckon.++++@++++You know, killing that gator was the best decision I ever made.
Got that right. / Durn tootin'. / Boy howdy.++++@++++Yep, this place is great. And someday, when Lisa and Bart get married, it'll all be theirs.
You mean, when they marry other people.++++@++++Okay, but I ain't payin' for two weddin's.
You just relax. I'll have you in jail by supper time.++++@++++You'd better.
Well, first up is the State of Florida vs. The Simpson Family.++++@++++Your Honor, I'd like to represent myself. Drunken hicks of the jury...
You hear me?++++@++++Uhh... no.
Simpson, we got a problem. The jazz pianist didn't show up.++++@++++Well, what am I supposed to do?
Flavor's gone.++++@++++That's what we've been trying to tell you.
Well, looks like you folks are free to go. But don't you set foot in the state of Florida again.++++@++++Fine. There are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
Well, we're still welcome in North Dakota and Arizona.++++@++++Arizona smells funny.
I can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call "love."++++@++++Poor Cyborganizer
Homer, sitting that close to the TV can't be good for you.++++@++++Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you.
You should get your eyes checked. I'm taking Bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?++++@++++Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
I love you, Daddy.++++@++++Too late.
We need something quick. My husband's eyes are really shot.++++@++++Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky!
Dad, I've got Maggie.++++@++++Who said that?
Hey, wake up.++++@++++Sorry.
Now, read the first line.++++@++++I... 8... P.P.
Better or worse?++++@++++Much better.
That pair is popular with celebrities like Val Kilmer...++++@++++Oo, my favorite Door.
And Yoko Ono...++++@++++Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band.
Maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery.++++@++++Would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
Well yes, but I must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects...++++@++++Less yappin', more zappin'.
Wait! You've gotta use these drops. They prevent your eyes from crusting over.++++@++++Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks.
Now Homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some Jack Daniels and a carton of smokes.++++@++++Yes, dear.
Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn?++++@++++Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...
And you will be a dancer.++++@++++Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes.
And you look adorable.++++@++++Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?
But I just... need more practice. See ya!++++@++++Oh! What's that awful sound?
Where's Lisa?++++@++++Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
There she is! Hi, honey! Wow, look at her go.++++@++++Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!
Stop clapping!++++@++++Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!
Oh, thanks, Dad.++++@++++I didn't think, I just acted.
See, honey? All you needed was to believe in...++++@++++What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the "On" position. See? "On."
I was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.++++@++++Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer...
Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby.++++@++++That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind.
Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things.++++@++++Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does.
Uh-oh. It's out of its matrix. Nobody move.++++@++++Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel.
Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!?++++@++++Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
No knife games on the kitchen table!++++@++++I didn't hit your precious table.
Dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!++++@++++Oh, that's just superstition.
Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry.++++@++++In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy.
Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married.++++@++++Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man.
Bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?++++@++++Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
Actually, that was Becky, too.++++@++++What are these things in the mashed potatoes?
Well, nobody's perfect. Let me just pick those out.++++@++++No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had.
Be right back.++++@++++Take your time!
Awww. / Oh, no.++++@++++Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say "When's the ice cream gonna get here?"
I'm not insane!++++@++++Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs!
Shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?++++@++++Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back.
The kids are saying if you say Bloody Margie five times, she'll appear. But then she gouges your eyes out.++++@++++I heard she mates with men, then eats them.
Oh. Well, then, I guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. Except you cutting my brakes!++++@++++Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad.
Mom!++++@++++You monsters! You've killed her!
Oh, I've got too much to do to take a nap right now. Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage. And Homer, since you're dressed for it, I got some S & M for ya: Scrubbing and Mopping.++++@++++Thank you.
But behind the chortles, this funny fivesome was trapped in a private hell.++++@++++Everybody wanted a piece of us.
Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. They almost drove me to fortified wine!++++@++++Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV.
I'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that Hollywood hogwash.++++@++++Our favorite show was "Hollywood Hogwash." But we also loved "The Dreck Squad"...
Home Improvement...++++@++++But we never saw people like us on TV.
Using his home as the studio, and his family as the cast, this penniless Peckinpah shot a crude five-minute video.++++@++++"My Funny Family," take one.
I haven't done the laundry yet.++++@++++Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.
Dad, that's too much deterge--++++@++++Not now. I'm busy turning on this washing machine.
Simp-son!!! Where's my dinner?!++++@++++Mamma mia!
Okay, the material was a little corny, but Homer and I had real chemistry onscreen.++++@++++Every day I thought about firing Marge. You know, just to shake things up.
The Simpsons had their foot in the door. Fox ordered thirteen episodes. But would the public respond?++++@++++...M-E-R. Okay.
R-U-P-E-R...++++@++++You're almost there.
...-T.++++@++++Good.
The funniest stuff came right out of real life.++++@++++Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.
Dad, I've never said "Cowabunga!" in my life. Your script sucks.++++@++++Why you little...!
Hey, that's funny!++++@++++And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
When we come back...++++@++++I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.
The script originally called for me to jump the gorge. But I'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.++++@++++Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.
Somehow, Homer became addicted to painkillers. It was the only way he could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.++++@++++Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!
The tax men were merciless.++++@++++Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there.
Dad, I want to go to bed. Aren't there child labor laws?++++@++++Who told you about those laws? Was it Marge?
Something that swings, with the beat of New Orleans.++++@++++No, something that rocks. That's the sound of today.
Swings!++++@++++Rocks!
Sadly, this argument was not part of the act.++++@++++I'll kill you!
Oh, that's it!++++@++++Hey, hey, stop it!
GOT A BROTHER NAMED BILLY / AND MY TEETH LOOK SILLY / BREAK IT DOWN NOW!++++@++++Who are you! I'll get you!
After the state fair fiasco... none of the family were speaking to each other. Fox put the show on hiatus, and replaced it with hidden camera footage from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.++++@++++That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater.
Oh, that must be our new landlord, Mr. Stingeley.++++@++++WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!
That's assault! That is assault.++++@++++It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean, emotionally, it was terrible. But the turkey was so moist.
Thank you, Taco, for that loving tribute to Falco. And now, to present the award for "Most Violent Rap Group," Homer Simpson!++++@++++Hi!
And Marge Simpson!++++@++++What?! What's she doing here?
Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug!++++@++++Yes, go on.
The Simpsons' bitter past was forgotten, and now the future looks brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky family.++++@++++We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip.
So you know it's great.++++@++++Why you little...!
I can't believe it. We won another contest!++++@++++The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
Why don't you read "Cathy"? She's hilarious.++++@++++Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: "Today you will die."
Maybe I'd better check mine. "Today, your husband will die." Homer, I'm scared.++++@++++Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of...
Yeah, it's quite fetching, but, uh, aren't you worried about the deadliness?++++@++++Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters.
No dessert until you eat your broccoli.++++@++++Fine.
Sure is easy when they're stiff like this. And very sad.++++@++++St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!
I wouldn't celebrate so soon, Mr. Simpson. I don't see a single good deed next to your name.++++@++++Well, the thing about that is...
Homer, settle down. I'll give you a chance to get into Heaven. You have twenty-four hours to go back and do one good deed.++++@++++I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds.
It's a miracle! Thank Heavens!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking.++++@++++Hey, I thought you guys could see everything.
No, you're thinking of Santa Claus.++++@++++Well I'll be damned.
Silence, sinner! Prepare for an eternity of horrible pain!++++@++++Oh no!
I just got over the plague.++++@++++Hello, Wife! Hello, children!
Maybe you could be a dunce, Father.++++@++++Really?
But Husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?++++@++++Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.
Go back and get them!++++@++++Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.
Father, I knew you'd rescue us!++++@++++Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good.
Uh, hello, I'm George Cauldron. Is Suzanne ready yet?++++@++++Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.
Speaking of which, how about seconds?++++@++++Comin' up!
Gray, bottle-nosed, intelligent Italians.++++@++++Intelligent Italians? Something's wrong.
Those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. We've gotta warn Grampa.++++@++++Hmm. Phone's off the hook. Everything must be okay.
That was you?!++++@++++It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you.
I, I, I tuned out. Where we goin'?++++@++++Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!
Oh, no. You poor thing. Here...++++@++++Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!
If I could just... This is really not... You're hurting my...++++@++++C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
No, there's a badger in there.++++@++++Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse.
Tons.++++@++++Get it.
No, Dad! We don't want to kill him! Let's call animal control.++++@++++Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.
How did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?++++@++++What am I, a tailor?
Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please make sure you have the correct area code.++++@++++Area code? But it's a local call.
The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. Half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939.++++@++++939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined.
Geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers.++++@++++Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.
I'm not sure which one's better. The 6 is closer to the 3, so you've got convenience there, but the 9 has less to do with Satan, which is a plus in this religious world of ours.++++@++++What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
Don't forget the leaflets they dropped from the space shuttle. And the two weeks we all spent at Area Code Camp.++++@++++Not a single word of warning.
... 0, 1, 1... aaannnd 3.++++@++++That's my number!
Ahoy hoy.++++@++++Hey, that's not me!
Congratulations, you're gonna rendezvous with the Who!++++@++++It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys.
You should call that radio station and let 'em have it.++++@++++Good idea.
... has been replaced by the convenience of two area codes.++++@++++Uh, I have a question, Phoney.
It's a movie, Dad.++++@++++Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question.
I like it.++++@++++Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!
I never!++++@++++And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job.
/ He's right. / We're gettin' it but good.++++@++++Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!
What are you pathetic slobs gonna do about it?++++@++++Well, I...
It worked on the test-corpse.++++@++++Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city!
Viva la revoluciÃ³n!++++@++++Now who's stupid?
Say, I couldn't help but overhear. I represent the Arizona Cardinals...++++@++++Keep walkin'
Yeah, maybe you oughta be Mayor of New Springfield.++++@++++Mayor, eh?
The Mayor... Starring Homer Simpson.++++@++++I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job.
Presenting our new plaque. I say the time for bitterness has passed. Let us extend to our brothers in New Springfield the olive branch of...++++@++++New Springfield rocks!
Go ahead and laugh! We have a better town bird!++++@++++Oh yeah? What is it?
The bluebird.++++@++++Damnit!
More wheat cakes, Mr. Mayor?++++@++++Read my lips: Yes.
Dad, you got syrup on your sash.++++@++++No problem.
If you ask me...++++@++++Stop right there.
... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. It would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.++++@++++Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career.
As expected, New Springfield's bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster.++++@++++Hey, the TV man is talking about us!
Scientists say they are also less attractive physically. And while we speak in a well-educated manner, they tend to use lowbrow expressions, like "oh yeah?" and "c'mere a minute."++++@++++Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute.
You c'mere a minute.++++@++++Oh yeah?
Dad, I don't think this is such a good idea.++++@++++Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity.
In retaliation for the power outage, Olde Springfield patriots have intercepted a beer truck bound for New Springfield and dumped all the beer in the river.++++@++++Those rich, snobby Indians.
I don't know. Vengeance is pretty good.++++@++++Woo hoo! Flood from water!
We can't go on fighting with Olde Springfield. These people are our neighbors. We see them every day.++++@++++You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
Like the one in Berlin?++++@++++Good idea. We should call the guys they used.
'Bout what?++++@++++Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all.
Bye Homer.++++@++++I can't believe all those rats fled my town.
Well, Dad, you're mayor of a ghost town.++++@++++I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine.
Dad, you're bleeding.++++@++++No problem.
Don't give up, Dad. Maybe we can get The Who to play here instead.++++@++++Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion.
Can I help you?++++@++++Uh...
Dad, the chloroform!++++@++++Huh? Oh, right.
Oh, yeah, right. I got fired by The Who. Whatever you say, pal. Wack-o...++++@++++Wow, The Who!
Yeah, we don't want to lose our pool privileges.++++@++++Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.
The mayor of New Springfield?++++@++++That's right.
The crazy mayor of New Springfield?++++@++++That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City.
Sacred bond.++++@++++C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of "My Generation," "Won't Get Fooled Again," and "Mama's Got a Squeeze Box"?
We know our songs, Homer.++++@++++But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge.
Just send a cab for us.++++@++++Somethin' wrong with your legs?
We were expecting a bigger crowd.++++@++++Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town.
And we don't know "Pacman Fever."++++@++++Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. "Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy." Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who!
Give us back our concert, Simpson!++++@++++So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts.
Daily?++++@++++We'll talk.
All right, enough chit chat. Let's see how ya like flaming garbage!++++@++++Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...
Uh, says you.++++@++++Magic Bus!
Okay, we'll play "Magic Bus" if you tear down this wall.++++@++++Pinball Wizard!
Oh hell, I'll do it myself...++++@++++Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over.
Hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening our garden.++++@++++Yeah, we're heroes... But where's our parade?
Or is it?++++@++++Yeah, it's hopeless.
I said, or is it?++++@++++I said, it's... Ohhh...
Homer, what are you doing?!++++@++++Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?
Ooo, baby.++++@++++Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007.
What's going on here?++++@++++Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room.
Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up Maggie's room.++++@++++Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?
You've ruined all my stuff.++++@++++Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you. Hey, pretend it's your birthday.
Well, the Book Festival starts today...++++@++++Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?
Mmmm.++++@++++okay.
Whaaa?!++++@++++Idiots.
Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip.++++@++++Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen.
Catch, Dad, catch!++++@++++Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey.
You know, Homer, I've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and I just realized I don't know the first thing about 'em.++++@++++Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Except for some mag wheels. Oh, man, that would be sweet.
Dad! Dad!++++@++++Just a second, honey. Daddy's on his high horse.
Daaaad!++++@++++Yeah, I'm watching, honey. Nice cannonball. Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'Cause over-thinking is... What were we talking about? Ooh, a clown.
My little girl's sharp as a tack. I tried the "got your nose" bit on her -- didn't fool her for a second.++++@++++My uncle still has my nose.
Fold-o-rama.++++@++++Can we make this hand high-low?
Oh yeah, right. Just let me go to my car.++++@++++A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A-WEEM...
I'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering.++++@++++Maybe so, but Dawson's gonna be bummed.
Oh, Krusty. I'm sure she just needs time to get used to you.++++@++++Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?
My daughter's violin!++++@++++Oh, right. Why don't we just break into Fat Tony's compound and get it back?
Really? You'd help me take on the mob?++++@++++For a casual acquaintance like you? Absolutely.
It's some kinda mafia summit! Every mob family in the country's here: the Cuomos, the Travoltas, the Lasordas, the Boy-ar-dees...++++@++++This is perfect! If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. Come on.
It's gonna take forever to go through all these!++++@++++I have a plan.
Then it's decided. Our website name will be crime dot org.++++@++++I think we're in the clear.
That's him! That's the one! Homer Simpson!++++@++++I said I was sorry.
Oh, all right. / Fair enough. / He's a class act.++++@++++Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!
Well, maybe I should.++++@++++So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?
Don't you call me a--++++@++++Take that, Lisa's beliefs.
Oh, how cute! Kids, look who's on the roof!++++@++++I knew this day would come. The cows are taking back what's theirs.
I can't believe how young he is. He'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.++++@++++Look, Marge! I'm in a limo! The Simpsons are going to Paris!
Shut up!++++@++++First comes love, then comes, um... Dammit, I know this.
Oh, thank you, thank you!++++@++++Have a good time at your hippie club.
You're welcome to come, too.++++@++++No, I like to save the environment in my own way.
They've undergone terrible hardships.++++@++++Well, moping won't make it better.
Mom, Dad, there's something I have to do. You're not gonna like it, but I really believe it's the right thing.++++@++++Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash.
It's okay, Mom! I have a safety line!++++@++++This is your fault, with your non-threatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks. No girl could resist your charms.
This was her choice, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. I was lost in your eyes.
Dad, I'm not dead!++++@++++Oh, praise God, you're alive! Unless...
Homer, it's Neddy. I baked you a little something to ease the pain.++++@++++Oh, must hide Lisa...!
Homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how Lisa is, ah,... how do I put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city.++++@++++Thanks for the beer, Moe. But before Lisa died, she made this tape that I think you should hear.
Dear Moe, if anything should ever happen to me, I want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... Dad, I can't--++++@++++Read it!
I'm not dead! And neither is my sense of moral outrage.++++@++++Oh, here we go.
Just a cotton-pickin' minute. I've been getting A's since Gymboree.++++@++++Well, what do you want, a medal?
You gave Bart one.++++@++++Love you.
I just buckled down and studied.++++@++++No, really.
Deadbeat. Deadbeat. Deadbeat.++++@++++Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid...
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY / STOP THEM, MARY-KAY!++++@++++Okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. What are you gonna do about it?
VA LA BAMBA / VA LA BAMBA...++++@++++Can we go now?
No, no. Your playing, while technically proficient, lacks passion.++++@++++Fine. You want passion? I'll give you passion.
When did this happen? When did we become the bottom rung of society?++++@++++I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
Dad, what happened to the back seat?++++@++++I had to sell it for gas money.
Maybe we should talk to a financial planner.++++@++++Financial panther, eh?
Mr. Simpson, you're a dollar overdrawn.++++@++++Get him, Sheeba!
Well, I see you have several mortgages, credit card debt, no savings, and you're supporting your father?++++@++++Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.
I couldn't ask you to do that.++++@++++Consider it done.
Based on these figures, I'm afraid you'll need to declare bankruptcy... several times. Just look at this projection.++++@++++Marge, your posture looks terrible.
Mr. Simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that you're too "stupid" to stick to a budget.++++@++++Yes, go on...
So let me put this simply: you need more money.++++@++++But how do I get it?
Oh, I concur. Word-a-day calendar.++++@++++I'm just trying to work up the courage to ask Burns for a raise. Or a highly-paid internship. Something to solve my money woes.
Hmmm. What is this? Some kind of force-field around these vegetables.++++@++++That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
Everything's so green and alive!++++@++++Mr. Burns... I was wondering if I could get a raise.
What kind of a raise?++++@++++Whopping?
I see. You have thirty seconds to wow me.++++@++++Well, sir... you see, sir... I've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well...
I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!++++@++++A laugh? Okay, let's see, what's in the news today?...
Oh, for the love of... Hurl this at that.++++@++++At Lenny? But he's a war hero!
Well, let's decorate him then.++++@++++No!
Not even for four dollars?++++@++++Okay.
That was capital - my lung is aching.++++@++++I liked when I threw the pudding.
Do it again! I'll make it an even eight.++++@++++You're the boss.
Let's keep the laughs coming, eh, Simpson? What say I make you my Executive In Charge Of Recreation -- No, no, better yet, my Prank Monkey.++++@++++Will you keep giving me money?
I can't have my little monkey running around in rags.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Look at that Comic Book Fellow calmly eating candy like a Spaniard. Time for monkey to shine.++++@++++I'd like to buy a mint condition "Spider-Man Number One," please.
Paper bag, or triple mylar?++++@++++Uh, no thanks. I'll just eat it here.
Oh, that was uproarious. First-rate job, monkey!++++@++++Do I get paid now?
Okay, now!++++@++++Little help?
The line in the lady's room is far too long and so I hope you don't mind if I...++++@++++Baby made a boom-boom.
There. That's six years' worth of inoculations.++++@++++Here you are, my good man. And while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots.
Oh, yes, sir!++++@++++Anti-polio.
Homie, where did you get that ball of money?++++@++++I've been doing some outside projects for Mr. Burns.
Really? Like what?++++@++++Oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling...
Look at their proud, hopeful faces. Wait'll they see that their rare Chinese panda is nothing but a fat guy in a suit.++++@++++Well, why do I have to do the Lindy Hop?
Oh, she's saying "I love you."++++@++++Can't take the pain...
Hey, there's our resident bull panda, Ping Ping. With any luck, folks, these two will become very, very close, if you know what I mean.++++@++++Huh? Help! Mr. Burns!
Hah. You ain't goin' nowhere, cutie.++++@++++Am I glad to see you guys. You gotta call...
Dad?? The panda was you?++++@++++Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.
So, this is your mysterious new job for Mr. Burns?++++@++++Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
Oh Dad, you have to stop.++++@++++I know.
Well done, Monkey! That other panda gave some unexpected zazz to the festivities, eh?++++@++++Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?
Too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting -- it's happened before. Monty say, monkey do. What could be better?++++@++++Well, you could treat me with a little respect.
Oh, shut up, you tub of guts.++++@++++You see, that's what I'm saying.
Not my Dad.++++@++++Shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey.
Dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?++++@++++She's right. Yes, I may be naked and reeking of panda love, but I've got to stop this before it goes too far.
Take that back for nine hundred and three dollars.++++@++++I retract my statement.
A poor man.++++@++++Huh? Oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?
Forget about him, Dad. I'm proud of you.++++@++++Aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should I do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? I better throw it in the garbage.
Well, there's lots of needy kids out there...++++@++++I see what you're saying -- I need to buy a gun.
No, Dad. You could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate.++++@++++You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
Yessss?++++@++++I'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. Is this enough dirty, dirty money?
Why, I don't think I've ever seen such generosity. You're a modern-day Kris Kringle, sir.++++@++++I'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
Say no more. I had a bit of a shoe-sniffing problem myself. I'm still not allowed on the third floor.++++@++++It's okay.
Wanna rehearse, Dad?++++@++++I don't need to rehearse. Ho, ho, ho, Merry... Line!
Christmas.++++@++++What? Lemme see that.
Prepare to be boarded!++++@++++What are you doing here? I told you I'm not your monkey anymore.
Not for one million dollars?++++@++++Oh, so much money...
Oh, Dad. You sold your soul.++++@++++Not yet, honey.
Didn't you get the e-mail?++++@++++What's an e-mail?
Or a quiet phone call.++++@++++I don't have a computer.
Why not? Anything goes today.++++@++++That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon as somebody lets me outta here!
Hmmm, well, do you need a paperweight? Because if you buy that machine, that's all you're gonna have. Is an expensive paperweight.++++@++++Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I really need is a computer. How about that one?
Mm-hm. That technology is three months old. Only suckers buy out of date machines. You're not a sucker, are you, sir?++++@++++Heavens, no!
Oh, good, because if you were I would have to ask you to leave the store.++++@++++I just need something to receive e-mail.
That's the same computer astronauts use to do their taxes.++++@++++I was an astronaut.
Of course you were.++++@++++Five thousand dollars!
You only have ten seconds to decide, sir.++++@++++This is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?
Dad, you shouldn't drag that around.++++@++++That's right! Top of the line!
Did I hear my name? My ears are burnin'.++++@++++Good start! Now finish the job!
Ah, you're busy. Catch you later, compu-tater.++++@++++$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
Dad, I'll set up your computer. Why don't you and Bart go play in the back yard?++++@++++You're it!
Okay, you're ready to go. I've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them.++++@++++Hmmmmm.
Homer, bring that back in the house.++++@++++Fine!
You have chosen no, meaning you've committed a crime, but don't want to confess. A paddy wagon is now speeding to your home.++++@++++Hey!
You have the right to remain fabulous!++++@++++Here it is, everybody! The world's greatest website!
I got suspended from school today.++++@++++No kiddin'. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. It's great, isn't it? Go ahead and say it's great if you want to.
I took a swing at a cop.++++@++++They can't sue me if they don't know who I am. I'll just call myself Mr. X.
I'm just mad all the time.++++@++++Yep, you can't go wrong with Mr. X.
Mom wants you to come to bed.++++@++++I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
You have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea...++++@++++That lousy pothole! Why don't they fix it?
I heard Mayor Quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.++++@++++Get out! Who told you that?
Nelson.++++@++++Hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page.
You can't post that on the Internet. You don't even know if it's true.++++@++++Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. Nelson is gold.
You know, it might've been Jimbo.++++@++++Beautiful. We have confirmation.
Good Lord! We've discovered the ruins of an ancient city! Okay, you do better.++++@++++I did it. I changed the world. Now I know exactly how God feels.
Do you want turkey sausage or ham?++++@++++Bring me two of every animal.
A new Internet watchdog is creating a stir in Springfield. Mr. X, if that is his real name, has come up with a sensational scoop.++++@++++Darn tootin'.
I'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. Maybe you should quit while you're ahead.++++@++++No way! Mr. X is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
Eh, who am I to point the finger? I once ran over a guy in a parking lot, and dumped the body on a golf course.++++@++++What a bombshell!
The public should be warned. I wish Mr. X were here.++++@++++Oh, I don't know, Carl. He might be closer than you think.
Are you him? Are you Mr. X?++++@++++No!
Uh, but you talked in that real sly voice. Hey, hey, everybody, Homer's Mr. X!++++@++++I am not. Or am I?
Are you?++++@++++No!
Well, if Mr. X were here right now, I'd buy him a tall frosty.++++@++++Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?
Oh, pshaw.++++@++++I love spying.
Let go of me! I'm innocent!++++@++++Whoa... He's in trouble.
Unfortunately, we don't know who he is. So his cash award will be used to feed starving children.++++@++++Nooo!
He is Mr. X! Hah!++++@++++Thank you, folks. And now I'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and...
I'm proud that you won the Pulitzer...++++@++++Finally.
But I do feel bad about the starving children...++++@++++They're with God now.
Oh, well, that's good... Oh.++++@++++Hey, guys. How's it goin'?
So hungry.++++@++++I smell another Pulitzer.
Well, you can't post news if you don't have any.++++@++++That's a great idea! I'll make up some news!
At least take off your Pulitzer Prize when you say that.++++@++++Let's see now... "BULLETIN: New Race Discovered Living Six Inches Under... Denver."
Oh, Dad...++++@++++All Named 'Morton'... or... 'Mortonson'...
Hey, Mr. X! I got a tip for ya. In science class, they're dissecting frozen hoboes. And I have the bindles to prove it.++++@++++Real news is great, son. But I'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-A bull plop.
This is... The Island.++++@++++How do I get outta here?
Oh, no one leaves The Island.++++@++++So I'm a prisoner? How come?
Because you know something.++++@++++But I don't know anything. At least I don't think I do.
See you tomorrow.++++@++++No you won't!
I'm Number 15. What number are you?++++@++++I am not a number, I am a man. And don't you ever... Oh, wait, I'm Number 5. Ha ha! In your face, Number 6!
Yes, well done.++++@++++Who are all these oddballs?
Well, they keep us here because we know too much. Number 27 there knows how to turn water into gasoline. Number 12 knows the deadly secret behind Tic-Tacs. And I invented the bottomless peanut bag.++++@++++Wow.
Uh, the shoes are part of the uniform.++++@++++Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness.
Hello, Number 5. How's every little thing?++++@++++Who are you and why are you holding me here? I want answers now or I want them eventually.
Ow. Please. Don't do that.++++@++++Sorry.
I'll be blunt. Your web page has stumbled upon our secret plan.++++@++++That's impossible. All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!
Oh don't be cute. I'm referring to the flu shot exposÃ©. You see, we're the ones loading them with mind-controlling additives.++++@++++But why?
To drive people into a frenzy of shopping. That's why flu shots are given just before Christmas.++++@++++Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated.
Yes it is. And we can't have you out there mucking it up now, can we?++++@++++No, sir.
There's a good boy. Let's get you some ice cream. There you are.++++@++++Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse.
I wouldn't count on that, Number 5. As far as your family knows, Homer Simpson is walking in the front door right about now.++++@++++I'm sorry. What?
I am a new tie wearing.++++@++++I'm tired of being drugged and gagged. There's gotta be a way to escaped.
Psst.++++@++++Huh?
Sorry, old chap. But you're proving quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk.++++@++++Huh?
We're shutting you down.++++@++++Not a chance. No one can silence me, but me!
That arranged can be.++++@++++Whuh?
Yes, fight and struggle!++++@++++If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch.
Can I turn this off?++++@++++Absolutely.
The dog thinks so, too.++++@++++The dog thinks so...
Once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place.++++@++++Oh, it's wonderful.
Welcome to the Magic Palace.++++@++++Okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding.
I'm receiving a drink order... Something foamy... Is it a beeee...?++++@++++Beer! Yes! How did you know?
Don't worry, Marge. You won't feel a thing. You'll feel four things.++++@++++He's very good.
"Ages 8 to 80." Hmm... That's me! Dad, will you get me this magic kit?++++@++++Gee, I wish I could, son, but we've already left the gift shop.
Hmmm. Well, there's your problem.++++@++++I know that. How much to fix it?
Ooh, well, ah, that's a foreign fish we're lookin' at... So, uh, sixty-five hundred. Plus three-fifty.++++@++++I can't afford that.
Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along.++++@++++He couldn't breathe.
Oh, my goodness!++++@++++Come on, pony up, Flanders. The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.
Oh, no! I could never support the black arts.++++@++++Black arts?!
Hey, you guys... You're in our spot!++++@++++Okay, we'll move. We don't want any trouble, fellas.
Dad, only one of them is real.++++@++++I know, but which one?
Hey, don't blame me. I gotta compete with TV, and the Internet.++++@++++A good son would come through for his dad!
Yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's Little League games!++++@++++I told you! I find them boring.
Well, I showed up for all your stupid interventions.++++@++++Oh, that's it! You can walk home!
Hey, Homer! Check it out!++++@++++What the?!
Yeah, I know a little place.++++@++++Who gave you all this money?
People. I guess they thought I was a charity case.++++@++++Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?
But wouldn't that make us con artists?++++@++++Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs.
So in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe.++++@++++There ya go! We'd be stealing from people we know. It's just like the seasons.
Sounds good. Wanna eat my fat?++++@++++I think you know the answer to that.
This book has all the classic cons. There's "The Pigeon Drop," "The Ear Wigger," "The Brillstein Grab..."++++@++++They have any father-and-son grifts?
Well, there's the "Albany Ham Scam."++++@++++Interesting.
What are you doing? Why are you frosting that old throw pillow?++++@++++I could ask you the very same question.
Should I just back out of the room?++++@++++Would you?
Okay, Dad. Ready for our first con?++++@++++You bet. Let's trim the mark.
Nice use of the lingo, Homer.++++@++++Ten-four, Kemosabe.
A storm is coming!++++@++++What have you done, you clumsy little ox?! That cake was for your deaf sister!
Sir, it was my fault.++++@++++No, no. Don't protect him. You'll work off that cake in the acid mines.
No, no, no. I'll pay for the cake.++++@++++Well, you're the mark.
Wow, look at all this loot! What should we buy first?++++@++++A singing rubber fish, of course.
There you are. How was the magic act?++++@++++What in the hell are you talking about?
Or so it would seem...++++@++++Suckers.
I just gotta get him back!... Or if not him, a similar dog...++++@++++Dog for sale!
How much for the dog?++++@++++Oh, he's not for sale.
Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?++++@++++In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.
Okay, I'm sold.++++@++++Hello, is the lady of the house in?
Oh, no, Homer, remember? Maudie got called up to Heaven.++++@++++Oh, of course, of course. It's just that...
Why, there's my name in gold.++++@++++Now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man...
Amateurs!++++@++++Dad?
Yeah, in the Depression, you had to grift. Either that, or work.++++@++++So what's the pitch, old man?
Oh, why not? If we don't take their money, they'll just give it to some televangelist.++++@++++Let's dust a few fossils.
I'm Abe Simpson.++++@++++You've just won 10 million dollars from that Publisher's Cleary-dealie!
Yeah, I'm gonna get me the craziest, strippiest...++++@++++He's dead.
Oh, this is terrible. Now who do we give the money to?++++@++++I guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
Forget it, Ed. Do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? Why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head.++++@++++You're right. We'd better just take this check back for shredding.
Call me mint jelly, 'cause I'm on the lam!++++@++++So we're under arrest for fraud?
Well, this is about the flashiest car I've ever impounded.++++@++++Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting.
Please, FBI man, don't throw us in jail. We just made one mistake.++++@++++Yeah. We're not criminals. We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids.
Hmm... Okay, tell you what. I'll let you turn yourselves in. Maybe they'll go easier on you.++++@++++You'd do that for us?
Well, I did ruin the boy's birthday cake. Go on in. But I'll be watching.++++@++++Okay, thank you, sir.
Okay, we're all locked up now...++++@++++Yeah. Ya big idiot...
That's not an FBI badge.++++@++++Colgate Cavity Patrol?
That guy was a grifter!++++@++++Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place.
It's ten in the morning!++++@++++Lies got us into this mess, son. From now on it's honesty all the way.
You were carjacked in the church parking lot?!++++@++++Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?
What did he look like?++++@++++Well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some...
Anything else?++++@++++Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.
Oh, dear. We don't want that.++++@++++Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay.
Homie! Homie, wake up! They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!++++@++++Huh? But that's impossible.
I didna do it, I tell ya.++++@++++Uh-oh.
What do you care, loner?++++@++++Well, look at that. But who called the police?
Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!++++@++++'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay.
Dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth.++++@++++Let's see how this plays out.
Mr. Simpson, could you describe your assailant to the court?++++@++++I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!
Dad! Tell them!++++@++++When the time is right...
Daa-ad!++++@++++Let's see where he's going with this...
Willie! As your employer, I insist that you...++++@++++Stop! This has gone on just long enough.
Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!++++@++++But Skinner got shot!
Yeah, we hornswoggled you good.++++@++++But what about the guy who took my car?
He's doing "Dreamcoat" at the dinner theater.++++@++++I can't believe everyone was in on it.
Willie wasn't!++++@++++Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?
Well, I'm gonna take the Broncos in this game. 'Cause the Packers will be blinded by Jerry's tie.++++@++++Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous.
Well, folks, he's got a point. Uh, with all our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think about...++++@++++Lenny, are you watching this?
Yeah, they really hurt that guy's feelings.++++@++++I know!
Ready for the circus, Homer?++++@++++Circus?
The Cirque de PurÃ©e. We've had tickets since Septembre.++++@++++But I wanna watch Bret Favre!
Finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder.++++@++++Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement.
As French Canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment.++++@++++I wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
But I cannot help you. I am just a local merchant from, uh... this town.++++@++++Just smash it open!
Mesdames et messieurs, it appears the Cloud Goddess is ripe with rain babies. We must run for our trucks.++++@++++Oh no you don't! I paid full price for this freak show. Now nourish the child within me! Nourish...
Lenny says we've got the day off! Yippee!++++@++++One snow angel, comin' up.
This is terrible. How will the kids get home?++++@++++I 'unno... Internet?
Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof.++++@++++My car, your roof. It's only fair.
But it's my car.++++@++++Well, yeah.
Sure you did -- "Mr. Plow." You're wearin' the jacket right now!++++@++++I think I know my own life, Ned.
Oh! I think we hit something.++++@++++I hope it's Flanders. I'm just kidding. Hey, you're all right.
Catchy song, all right. You really wrote it?++++@++++Yeah, as a tribute to Princess Di. And Dodi. Because these days, princesses...
Well, better turn off that engine. Before those fumes put us in tombs.++++@++++Wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles.
Homer! Wake up! The car's filling with...++++@++++I know, ranch dressing.
Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!++++@++++We're free! And we've got something to eat.
Now let's go save those kids.++++@++++You're the camel.
We're gonna crash!++++@++++Do you have airbags?
Gotcha!++++@++++C'mon, kids. Let's leave this awful place and never come back.
And the exhaust pipe is leaking.++++@++++Whuh?
Ignore her, Effendi. We have each other.++++@++++Oh, baby!
Folks, you're about to witness the exciting new process of motion-capture animation.++++@++++Pick me! Pick me!
Now, when we activate the suite, our furry friend will copy you exactly.++++@++++I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT / SHORT AND STOUT / HERE IS MY HANDLE / HERE IS MY SPOUT.
That would be the world's funniest marsupial.++++@++++You're right. That suit gizmo could be worth billions. And I'm gonna get a piece of the action!
Uh, Sir, this is a joint account. Uh, you'll, need your wife's signature, too.++++@++++Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant.
Here's your candy.++++@++++So long, sucker!
Uh, sir? Your life savings.++++@++++Uh Yes, I see that it's in bill form. Excellent.
Okay... Uh, now, before I execute this order, are you sure you understand the risks of stock ownership?++++@++++Absolutely.
For automated stock prices, please state the company name.++++@++++Animotion.
Animotion. Up one and one-half.++++@++++Yahoo!
Yahoo. Up six and a quarter.++++@++++Huh? What is this crap?
Turning to the stock market, Animotion is up an eighth...++++@++++Yes!
... after plunging seventy-five points this morning.++++@++++Oh, I hope "plunging" means "up," and "seventy-five" means "two hundred."
Burn! Burn! Burn!++++@++++Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.
Are you crazy?! I'm not going to be a surrogate mother.++++@++++C'mon, Marge. We're a team! It's uter-us, not uter-you.
You know, Homer, I got a great way to make money -- I'm a human guinea pig.++++@++++You mean, like, medical testing?
Oh, oh, right, okay.++++@++++Yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?
Ow! Not so loud.++++@++++Hmmmm.
First, we'll test this experimental perfume on you.++++@++++It burns! It burns!
Homer, you really have no desire to eat that food?++++@++++Food? I'm BLIND!
He must've brought it in with him.++++@++++Dammit!
Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you have a crayon lodged in your brain.++++@++++There's a crayon in my brain?!
Do you have any idea how this might have happened?++++@++++Well, I'm not sure, but it mighta happened when I was six.
Mr. Simpson, this could be responsible for your subnormal intelligence.++++@++++Hey, I came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted.
We could remove the crayon for you. It could vastly increase your brain power... or it could possibly kill you.++++@++++Hmmm. Increase my killing power, eh? Let's do it.
Oh, Homer, where have you been?++++@++++I just underwent a procedure to increase my IQ fifty points.
Do you feel smarter?++++@++++Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?
I don't believe it. Say something else smart.++++@++++Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect.
I'd love to go to the library with you.++++@++++It's a date!
Dad, did you read all these books today?++++@++++Everything from Hop on Pop to Death Be Not Proud. It's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop.
I always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.++++@++++Get out!
Oooh, found a new short cut?++++@++++Better. I was working on a flat tax proposal, and I accidentally proved there's no God.
Welcome to the third lecture in our series on "Not Putting Things Up Your Nose." Please welcome Homer Simpson.++++@++++I am here to give hope to the least of you. Because we all have a crayon up our nose. Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
Question!++++@++++Yes, Nelson?
A moron says what?++++@++++Not being a moron, I wouldn't know. However, .
Wake up, Homer.++++@++++Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your moron!
Whatcha mailin', Homer?++++@++++I've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
How come you're not giving it to Mr. Burns?++++@++++I've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Yeah, it's nice to have someone with brains in this nuclear plant. Homer's the guy who rigged up my pants with this special codpiece.++++@++++Comfy, isn't it?
I can't feed my family with a codpiece.++++@++++Wait, you can't hate me. I'm your better! Your better!
Don't tell me how to feel.++++@++++So you all hate me?
You ain't welcome here no more, smart boy.++++@++++Hmm, I'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern...
I make a lot of graphs.++++@++++Well, what gets you through the day?
Oh, many things: Tai Chi, Chai Tea... But I find, when I can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk.++++@++++A walk? That's a really good idea.
Is that your final answer?++++@++++I don't understand. That wasn't funny.
Wait a minute! Somebody's not laughing here. It's him!++++@++++Hey, don't blame me. This movie is tired and predictable. You know she's gonna wind up marrying Richard Gere.
... ably played by Bill Paxton.++++@++++It's Bill Pullman, you fool!
Point out your plot holes elsewhere!++++@++++Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?
I'm sorry. We don't play God here.++++@++++That's ridiculous. You do nothing but play God! And I think your octoparrot would agree.
Look, what if we gave you the name of an unlicensed surgeon?++++@++++Oh, that would be heaven!
So whaddaya want here? Uh, Appendectomy, lipo, or the "sampler"? That's very popular.++++@++++I want you to stick this crayon into my brain.
All right, tell me when I hit the sweet spot.++++@++++Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher.
All right, all right.++++@++++Dee-fense! Dee-fense!
That's pretty dumb... But uh...++++@++++Extended warranty? How can I lose?
Sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere.++++@++++Who wants lottery tickets?
Dad, how could you? We were connecting in such a meaningful way.++++@++++We were what what in a what what?
Hey, what's this?++++@++++The wrestler?
Oh, Dad.++++@++++Huh? Oh, you want a hug. Well that, I know how to do.
Oh no!++++@++++Whuzzit... My juice box!
Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today.++++@++++Just give me ten more hours.
They're unveiling a combination apron/smock. It's called a "Smapron."++++@++++Did you say "Smockron"?
No, "Smapron."++++@++++Oh.
And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.++++@++++Heh, heh. "Grill Power."
I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons.++++@++++It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?
Somebody help him!++++@++++Relax, they've got rodeo clowns.
Hey! Hey, over here! Here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!++++@++++That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red.
How's your back, Homie?++++@++++I can't complain.
Naw, that's for the prisoners. You can complain all you want.++++@++++Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!
Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right?++++@++++Uh-huh.
Wow. The artist really captured Jimi's passion and intensity.++++@++++And his fondness for the guitar.
Look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. I'm askin' you, what's it breathin'?++++@++++Air?
Ain't no air in space.++++@++++There's an Air in Space Museum.
How's your back, Dad?++++@++++Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?
Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?++++@++++First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you.
Oh, Homie. I knew you'd support me.++++@++++My back!
Your spine is more twisted than Sinbad's take on marriage.++++@++++So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
Oh, I'd love to. But, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. We spend too much time on the front.++++@++++Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front.
I'm gonna send you to my chiropractor.++++@++++Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors.
Hello, Homer. I'm Doctor Steve. Please lie down.++++@++++Less yakkin', more crackin'.
There we go.++++@++++Hey, it feels a little better.
Honestly, it wouldn't bother me.++++@++++One, two, better-not-sue...
I'm just yankin' your chain. I'm Jewish.++++@++++Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything.
Did you do those exercises he gave you?++++@++++Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying.
That trash can must have unkinked your back.++++@++++Not "trash can," son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending.
Okay, okay.++++@++++And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains.
You remember Jack... He's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.++++@++++You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?
So, Homer, you think you can fix my sciatica?++++@++++Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp.
Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness.++++@++++Next!
Simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. And you're stealing patients from me and Dr. Steffi!++++@++++Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony...
You've been warned. Stop chiropracting.++++@++++Not unless you think about the irony.
Careful, I'm frail.++++@++++Okay, that should do it, Moe.
Is this El ClÃ­nico MagnÃ­fico?++++@++++Ah, you saw our bus ad.
We'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device.++++@++++We might be able to do business.
We'll need to take some photographs.++++@++++Hey, where're you going with that?
Whooaa.++++@++++Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that.
C'mon, c'mon, let's go!++++@++++Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box.++++@++++Five? Why don't we make it fifty?
I'll call poison control. Fran, it's me. Just a heads-up.++++@++++Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals...
You said it, partner!++++@++++So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back!
And you are banned for life from all of my performances and TV specials.++++@++++I can still see your movies, right?
Ooh, it says here that special effects whiz Tom Savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!++++@++++Tom Savini?
I can't believe I'm gonna miss that!++++@++++Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.
How could you have it planned out? You just heard about the problem.++++@++++You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.
You two are not welcome.++++@++++Sorry, son.
Thanks for the tip-off.++++@++++No problem.
Good evening. Sorry... I-I had a really big dinner...++++@++++Woo! Dinner!
Sure, computer technology is here to stay. But there'll always be a place for the practical special effects wizard.++++@++++I love the theater.
Hey Homer, who's the manatee?++++@++++Aw, now, be nice, Moe. This guy just got out of the hospital.
Uh, piece o' crap.++++@++++C'mon, you're here to make friends.
So many restaurants...++++@++++I can't decide. I throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
Umm... I guess I'll, I'll have the chicken Tandoori.++++@++++And I'll have the beef Wellington.
You know what else scares me? Everything!++++@++++Get that one! Faster! You got half time for the other ones. Oh, good. Oh no, that one's slowing up! Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbling! Oh, up... you got that before I even said it.
Hmm. Well, this autopsy coupon appears to be valid. What other funerary services may we provide for the pre-deceased?++++@++++Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray.
Sir, we prefer the term "casket" to "coffin." And "monument" to "tombstone." We have all the leading brands of anti-stink spray.++++@++++What funny names.
Heh, heh, heh. Look at 'im go.++++@++++That thing got picture-in-picture?
Of course! This is the "Contempo."++++@++++Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?
Ooh, bury me over here. Pleeeease?++++@++++Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey.
Hear that? If you cheapskate me into Hell, I'll haunt you good. Imagine this when you're sittin' on the john:++++@++++Okay!
O-kay, with mole insurance, your total comes to... seventeen thousand dollars.++++@++++What?!
Or, you could just toss him in the woods and let the wolves carry him off. It's really up to you.++++@++++Mr. Salesman?
Yesss?++++@++++We're gonna go with the wolves.
The Mauso-palooza can be seen from space. It will consume as much cement as a regulation-size tennis court.++++@++++Tennis court, eh?...
Oh, I can't believe we went through all that, just to wind up with a tennis court.++++@++++I'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
You don't care what happens to me when I die.++++@++++Of course I do, Dad.
Practicing tennis.++++@++++That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
Foxy boxing?++++@++++Yes! That's what I wanted!
You know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. I hear Mel Brooks has one. I mean, Sir Mel Brooks.++++@++++And it's bad news for the gophers.
And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.++++@++++Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over.
Hey, you got a tennis court.++++@++++Keep walkin', Flanders.
Will do.++++@++++Fas-ter.
We win again!++++@++++Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.
Match point.++++@++++And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?
That's game, set, and match to us. But the real winners here are Marge's hors d'oeuvres.++++@++++Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?
I guess you could say, "I'm Iraqi!"++++@++++Get off my property.
Especially bonnets.++++@++++I've had it with that school!
Will you get serious, Homer? I'd like to win at least once.++++@++++Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf...
Hey, Homer. Here's a bloopie for ya.++++@++++I've got it! It's in the bag!
You'll never guess what I heard in the supermarket today. I found out we're the laughingstock of the town.++++@++++Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed.
I thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. Instead, people make fun of our lousiness.++++@++++Okay, now some of that is me.
All of that is you. You've gotta take this more seriously.++++@++++Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored.
No, it's a smooth motion... You follow through with your racket.++++@++++Uh-oh.
What? We're not ready to compete!++++@++++Don't worry. The tournament's not till tomorrow. Okay, get ready for the serve.
Get 'em off! Get 'em off!++++@++++How embarrassing. You take over, Bart.
Oh, that's okay. Bart's doing fine. You just have another beer.++++@++++Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
I don't know what this has to do with the Civil War.++++@++++I'm getting to that.
Oh. Hi Dad.++++@++++With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament.
I am playing in the tournament.++++@++++It's gonna be tough without a partner.
I've got a partner.++++@++++Well, good for you! Anyone I know?
Oh, hello, Homer.++++@++++Good morning, partner!
Uh, there's something I should tell you.++++@++++The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
Well, actually, the name of Bart's partner is...++++@++++Yes, darling?
I'm Bart's partner.++++@++++No. No, no, no. You're my partner.
Oh, I'm sorry, Homie. We'll talk about it later, okay?++++@++++Nooo!
Oh, Homey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.++++@++++Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.
I just wanted to win for once. Please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.++++@++++My manhood? I never thought of that!
We can wipe out B.C. in our lifetime.++++@++++I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment.
Dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. You remember the story of Oedipus, don't you?++++@++++Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.++++@++++Who pays for that wedding?
I'm just saying you feel threatened by Bart, but it's all in your head.++++@++++You're right. But just to be safe, maybe I should chain him up.
Dad, I think you're overreacting.++++@++++I think you're underreacting.
This session's over.++++@++++This session's under.
Goodbye.++++@++++Badbye.
Are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?++++@++++Absolutely, sweetie.
And you're not doing it out of spite?++++@++++No, of course not. Now aim for your mother's heart.
Dad, I don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt Mom.++++@++++Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!
Did you make that awful effigy?++++@++++Hey, leave my teammate alone!
Oh, you little-- Come on, Bart.++++@++++Babies.
Telegram for Lisa Simpson.++++@++++Don't listen. It's a trick!
Dear Lisa. Psych. Psych, psych, psych. Signed, Super-psych.++++@++++I think he's trying to psych you out.
Huh? Ehh, whaddaya want? I'm not gonna do "A" material for charity. And after all, that is why we're here.++++@++++Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down.
No we're not. You're going down.++++@++++Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!
All we can do is play our very best.++++@++++Oh, that's loser talk!
Now I'd like to introduce two of the tennis world's most unbeatable players, Venus and Serena Williams.++++@++++Unbeatable, eh?
That's our Dad's seat.++++@++++Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new doubles partner. My little girl's a lead weight.
You're dumping your own daughter?++++@++++Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.
Yeah, that's pretty low.++++@++++Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!
Our next match is Marge and Bart Simpson...++++@++++Booo! You rot!
...versus Homer and Lisa...++++@++++Up- bup...
Venus Simpson? You're replacing me?++++@++++Now Lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm replacing you.
Yes! I'm in.++++@++++Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.
You're Andre. I'm Serena.++++@++++You're a girl.
Me neither. I'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.++++@++++You know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.
After the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner.++++@++++Courtesy of Pete Sampras.
I can't believe Krusty's retiring. This is tragic!++++@++++A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?
Nutsy the clown.++++@++++Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
I was at the flower shop.++++@++++Oh, yeah, uh, I was at the flower shop today, too. Yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop.
Thank you, folks. Now, fasten your funny belts, as our own Chimpendale's dancer gives you the Full Monkey!++++@++++Take it off!
Time to blow up the clown...++++@++++Go. Blow.
And in 1984, Portugal's Carlos Lopez becomes the oldest Olympic marathon winner ever at age 38.++++@++++38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon.
Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life.++++@++++Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher.
You got all your equipment, Dad?++++@++++Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check.
Attention, runners. On your mark, get set, now get outta here before I change my mind.++++@++++I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!
Well, thank you for lettin' me chill in your crib.++++@++++And thank you for assuming we're hip.
Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star.++++@++++And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
But...++++@++++How many lives must you ruin?
Don't be selfish, Lisa.++++@++++Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.
What does it mean?++++@++++Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like "rama-lama ding dong" or "give peace a chance".
Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?++++@++++Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya!
Cut it out! You're a grown man!++++@++++I wanna go home now.
Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy!++++@++++Yeah, that's the look.
Defuse it old school!++++@++++'Bout time.
They called me "Smelson"! Haw haw.++++@++++Smelson! It's funny 'cause you smell.
Are you sick of ordinary-shaped amusement parks?++++@++++Am I ever!
It was all right, I guess.++++@++++Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!
Squaresville sounds pretty cool.++++@++++I am a robot. Do what I say.
But you made it out of ham cubes.++++@++++Yep, a shiny new apple.
Hey, boat twenty-eight, stop splashing!++++@++++What are you gonna do about it?
It's okay, but it's missing a piece.++++@++++Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try.
What kind of a thing is that to tell your children?++++@++++It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.
I'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.++++@++++You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!
Yaaayy!++++@++++'Scuse me.
Hey, tough luck, pal. You can't fight the Souvenir Industry. We're too powerful.++++@++++Yeah, you're right.
Thank you, Dad.++++@++++Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine.
You idiot. They were beating out my shirt fire!++++@++++My heart was in the right place, jerk!
Thanks again, Dad.++++@++++Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?
Bart's got a problem!++++@++++Don't worry, son. I'll handle this.
He's a smelly ugly dork.++++@++++Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?
Tommy.++++@++++Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent.
They wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.++++@++++They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey.
Yes, may I help you?++++@++++Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!
Why are you doing zese things?++++@++++Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed.
I cannot streak that much hair. Think of the cost. I'd be ruined!++++@++++Oh, really...
You see? Zees is what I'm...++++@++++Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
But we must have it. It is ze lifeblood of ze industry.++++@++++You get the same results with a mincing gel.
Oh, Homie, I love them. I can't thank you enough.++++@++++The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.
I tried to return my season ticket, but they wouldn't give me my money back. They said they wanted it.++++@++++Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny.
Nope. This is the equipment shed.++++@++++Oh.
That's where we keep the water heater.++++@++++Is...
That's a tractor.++++@++++I see.
Sir, we can't give your friend a refund just because the team is losing.++++@++++I'm sorry to hear that.
Spin that back to where it was.++++@++++Yes, sir.
This meeting is over.++++@++++Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?
No, no, not that door!++++@++++Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?
It's not anything. It has no purpose.++++@++++What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.
No, no. There's no 'ohhhh.'++++@++++You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?
No, no, we would never abandon our loyal Springfield fans. By the way, all this barging into rooms marked "PRIVATE" must have made you thirsty. Would you like a beer?++++@++++Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today.
Now, Homer, we've developed this additive that makes beer super, super malty. Care to try it?++++@++++Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?
Good grief.++++@++++Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?
All night. You were yelling at the swing.++++@++++I was? But I love the swing.
Dad, you were nuts.++++@++++You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. "I'll be quirky..." Albuquerque! I'll be right back!
He's right, folks. The only story here is the rich, smooth taste of Duff.++++@++++Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!
Well, Homie, I believe you're telling the truth about the Isotopes.++++@++++I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth.
There's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. Bob Dylan wrote songs. Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.++++@++++That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.
Oh, Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. You eat while you brush your teeth. You're eating a huge sausage right now.++++@++++So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!
You're really not gonna eat anything?++++@++++My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains.
Dad, I'm so proud of you. If you need some inspiration, here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs.++++@++++Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.
Goodbye, Homie. Here's Dr. Hibbert's number if you feel weak.++++@++++Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
Stop calling me that.++++@++++Hey kid and man!
Liars?++++@++++They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.
Oh, Seymour!++++@++++Nice try, God.
Yeah, but his weary shuffling makes my heart smile.++++@++++I'm soooo hungry.
Yeah, duck man! Over here!++++@++++Do they have to chew so loud?
The spirit of Cesar Chavez.++++@++++Why do you look like Cesar Romero?
Because you don't know what Cesar Chavez looks like.++++@++++Why are you here?
To tell you not to give up.++++@++++But I wanna!
Okay, Skinny, on your feet.++++@++++What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?
Well, Homer. Your hunger strike lasted twelve amazing days.++++@++++Me so hungee.
Of course you are, Hungry Hungry Homer. So why not break your fast with our brand new Isotope Dog Supreme?++++@++++So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeÃ±o relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!
Now, now, now, now see here, people... Let's not be too hasty.++++@++++Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!
Get him out of here.++++@++++Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!
Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!++++@++++The truth never tasted so good!
That ad campaign may have crossed a line.++++@++++What can you do? Sex sells.
Homer, you're still here? You should've left for work an hour ago!++++@++++They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance.
Yep. It's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?++++@++++You read my mind. Sooo...
Yeah. The uh... the milk really takes the edge off.++++@++++You know, I think our marriage is...
I got it!++++@++++I got it!
No, I got it!++++@++++No, I do!
Springfield Baby-Proofing?++++@++++You...you really scared us.
Goo goo. Me wike to expwore.++++@++++That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
Similac Baby Formula.++++@++++Noooo!
Okay, with the window bars, toilet latches, dingo alarm, and grapefruit-squirt shield, your total cost would be... Wow, I'm rich!++++@++++Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.
Here's your estimate.++++@++++Mm hm. Hmmmm.
She's not afraid of bunnies.++++@++++She will be.
No, no, no. Oh, Homie!++++@++++Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.
I'm the one who told you that.++++@++++Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete.
How are you supposed to dial?++++@++++Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.
Isn't that a little excessive? I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?++++@++++Baby could order poison.
I'm a horrible mother.++++@++++Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world.
Oh, thank you. No more Shiva-related pokings.++++@++++Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha.
But we are Hindu.++++@++++So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it.
Booo!++++@++++Canceled.
The safe-baby craze. It's sweeping Springfield, thanks to one crusading parent.++++@++++That's me! Safety dance!
The dream is over. Shut her down, boys.++++@++++Dear God, what have I done?
I have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. I call it "Poindextrose".++++@++++Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.
Oh, honey, we're so proud of you.++++@++++So all her bullying was just to get some attention.
No, Dad! Didn't you listen to anything I said?++++@++++Just to get some attention.
Someone's gonna sleep well tonight.++++@++++Pound that nerd.
Candy Class.++++@++++Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home.
My teacher said I need cupcakes. Cupcakes to learn.++++@++++In the cart.
I'm out of wine.++++@++++Cart.
We need these because we have... to...++++@++++My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...
In the cart.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Sir, please. I've already bagged it by color, and in order of each item's discovery by man.++++@++++The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush!
Hey, hey, watch what you're doin' there, sack monkey. You're bruisin' my DuraLog.++++@++++Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.
Please. Ow. Stop. Bag boys have feelings, too, you know.++++@++++No you don't...
Excuse me? Is there a problem here?++++@++++No, I can handle it. I'll get you, squealer.
Strike! Strike! Strike!++++@++++Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking.
Mr. Simpson, please. Will you go home?++++@++++If I can have this rubber stick.
Hey, the dog smells something!++++@++++Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.
Homer, no! Those were made in the Sixties.++++@++++Mmmm... turbulent.
"Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."++++@++++Africa? They're bound to have food there!
We make household poisons and Christmas lights.++++@++++Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.
An old box of cookies is not a legal contract.++++@++++Ow! My eye!
Mr. Simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Uh, yes?++++@++++On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins.
He is our leader. He seized power in a bloodless coup. All smotherings.++++@++++Just like Jimmy Carter.
I will come down for your bags.++++@++++That's okay. I got 'em.
Ooh, look, everybody!++++@++++Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.
Wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.++++@++++What did you just see, Lisa?
I know, but...++++@++++What did you just see?
That's terrible!++++@++++Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born.
This is the earliest known fossil of a human being. It's over two million years old.++++@++++I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed.
It's not the number of bones, sir, it's the...++++@++++You have failed.
Oh, thank you. Your ground is so comfortable.++++@++++By the way, what kind of blood is this?
This song has been going on for hours.++++@++++Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!
Now, Simpsons! Run for it!++++@++++Good ol' Kitenge.
The left! Go to the left!++++@++++It's working!
Wonder where this river goes.++++@++++I've got a map!
Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls!++++@++++Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One...
Oh, no! It's eating us!++++@++++Not a chance.
Wow, Dad. How did you do that?++++@++++It's a flower.
Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet? Are we insane yet?++++@++++I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel.
Mount Kilimanjaro?++++@++++Go.
Hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas.++++@++++Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
Thank you. See, Jojo, she likes it.++++@++++So, I notice your home smells of feces.
Every day I get up at five-thirty, watch the chimps, eat a quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-watching. After dark I come home and think about chimps until it's time for bed.++++@++++You must be the most boring woman on earth.
Possibly, but...++++@++++I mean I knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez.
Absolutely not! Will you help me defend the refuge?++++@++++Anything for these noble animals.
She's one of the ten richest chimp researchers in the world.++++@++++Look at me, I'm a scientist!
Buzz off.++++@++++Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job.
Hm, quite a promotion.++++@++++I was wondering what became of him.
/ Oh, he got overthrown!++++@++++Now he's just a stinking flight attendant! Hey, where's my pillow?
Breakfast!++++@++++Breakfast!
I'll get us out of this. Say Dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?++++@++++No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.
Meet Linguo, the grammar robot. I built him all by myself. If you misuse language, he'll correct you.++++@++++Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer.
I love beer.++++@++++Aw, he loves beer.
This is why I can't have nice things.++++@++++Ooo, can I have a brownie?
They're for after dinner.++++@++++Ooo, can I have dinner?
You can't have a brownie. Period.++++@++++Homer wants a brownie! I'm gonna get one!
Stop it!++++@++++Or is it the right?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!++++@++++Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!
Calm down! If we hurry, they can reattach your thumb.++++@++++Reattach a thumb? This isn't "Gattaca."
123 Fake Street. Got it.++++@++++Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back. You want people food? I can get you people food.
What the diddly-yo?!++++@++++Give me back my thumb!
We've gotta get to the hospital, Homer!++++@++++Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women.
Homer, help!++++@++++Marge, over here.
I'm sorry, Homer. Your H.M.O. doesn't cover this type of injury.++++@++++But I have finger insurance!
Well, I could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry.++++@++++Symmetry, eh?
No problem. Just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. That'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.++++@++++Thanks, Moe.
Hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?++++@++++Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer...
Inflammable means flammable? What a country!++++@++++Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
Hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.++++@++++Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
Dad, no!++++@++++I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot, like in that play I wrote.
Hang on, Linguo. You'll be up and conjugating in no time.++++@++++My thumb!
Not right now. Your father's in there and --++++@++++Did you ever see that "Blue Man Group?"
Bad grammar overload. Error! Error!++++@++++What the hell...?
It's all right, boys.++++@++++Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!
Exactly.++++@++++One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven.
No, I'm not!++++@++++Leave Ned alone.
Thank you, Homer.++++@++++He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.
It says I have cooties.++++@++++Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties.
That was great. I can't believe she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.++++@++++Hey, she's coming this way!
Eh, they'll all go to hell. Say how's your life going?++++@++++Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.
That's great. Maybe we could have coffee sometime.++++@++++Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime.
I can hear her, Homer.++++@++++He can hear you, Rachel.
Okay, well maybe another time. You know, I better go check into my hotel.++++@++++Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not over Maude at all.++++@++++Yeah, maybe it was too soon.
Always do.++++@++++Say bye, Mr. Flanders.
Poor Ned. He can't look anywhere without being reminded of Maude.++++@++++Yeah, a lifetime of memories.
Homer, don't you have any respect?++++@++++Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth.
Wow, three pairs of shoes. Someone had a fetish.++++@++++Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up.
Kinda.++++@++++Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.
You said we were doing this out of friendship.++++@++++What? That doesn't sound like me.
Maude's old sketch book. She was quite the little artist, you know.++++@++++Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone.
Maude designed a Christian amusement park. Oh, it must have been her final dream.++++@++++Hey, how 'bout that?
Ah, Gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene.++++@++++You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.
Are you nuts?++++@++++Relax. It's a "controlled burn"... Uh-oh.
Darn teenagers with their beer bottles.++++@++++Uh, yeah, teenagers.
Well, it's been a tad harder than I thought, but I'm not complaining 'cause I work for a sweet, sweet, boss. You're our foreman, Maude.++++@++++She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that?
Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff.++++@++++I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
Well thanks, Homer.++++@++++No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp.
You can have these, ah, fireworks I confiscated. Some Chinese people claimed they were celebrating New Year's in February.++++@++++Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams.
This sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. It's Willie's special blend.++++@++++Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?
Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park.++++@++++Don't say that, Ned!
Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation.++++@++++Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it.
Oh, there's no explaining God's will, Roddy. That's like explaining how an airplane flies.++++@++++Stupid grill!
You better stick your head in and see what's going on.++++@++++Good idea.
I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt.++++@++++Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.
May the Lord have mercy on your gas sniffin', orphan beatin', soul.++++@++++Christ be with you.
Hey, Ned! I just read about your park in that horrible Triple-A magazine.++++@++++Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not!
So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?++++@++++I think Ned is gonna be all right...
I know. We'll never see any of you again.++++@++++You got that right
My turn, huh? Let's see...++++@++++Pick me! Pick me! I've got hoop dreams, coach. I've got 'em bad.
Okay. Homer.++++@++++Yes! Losers! Lo-sers! Lo-sers! L-- You said "Homer," right?
Mm-hm.++++@++++Lo-sers!
Willie tickles the twine for two! Oi! Oi!++++@++++Okay guys, I've got a secret play I've been saving for the Olympics or possibly the Final Four, and it goes something like this... Uh, Skinner I want you... Moe, you can take ... Homer, you can take Groundskeeper Willie. No way am I taking Groundskeeper Willie. Yes you are. Are you a team player or not?
Oh my goodness, an untied shoelace. I'll just get down on one knee and retie that.++++@++++Eat my dust, mortals!
Homer, I'm afraid you've torn out your anterior cruciate ligament.++++@++++Did you say anterior?
Now, how did this happen?++++@++++Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
It happened today.++++@++++Hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. Anyway it all started when...
You go, Homer!++++@++++Jet-son!
We've got to get you into surgery.++++@++++Maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
But it will take plenty of time and rehab before you can go back to work.++++@++++Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
Oh, you're also responsible for this hefty hospital bill. You shouldn't have ordered all those hospital haircuts and porno films.++++@++++But "Dr. Screwlittle" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!
Now Homer, I want you to stay off that leg for two weeks.++++@++++Two weeks?! Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit on my ass and watch TV? That ain't my style, man!
Now, Homer, there are people right through that door that have it much worse than you.++++@++++No they don't.
There goes my wagging finger.++++@++++I'm so bored.
Hey, Homer!++++@++++Oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. Stupid Flanders.
It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?++++@++++Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue.
Would you mind watching the kids? I'm kinda in a pickle here.++++@++++Well, they would keep me company. And this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal.
Mr. Simpson, can we have another jelly and candy sandwich?++++@++++Sure, knock yourselves out, and call me Homer.
Daddy said it's rude to call grownups by their first name.++++@++++Daddy's not here, is he?
PokÃ©mon? PokÃ©mon? With the pokey and the mon and the...++++@++++That is the darnedest thing!
He told us how the world keeps screwing him over.++++@++++Yeah, well. How was the concert?
Well, sir, I never heard a preacher use the "m-f" word so many times. Anyway, thanks again.++++@++++Hey, it was fun. My kids are sick of all my stories. But they just can't get enough of me!
Oh, Roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center.++++@++++Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
So you are running a day care center?++++@++++Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school.++++@++++Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face.
Why did you put my name on the sign?++++@++++It's just a legal thing, to protect me.
Is your knee really gross under there?++++@++++See for yourself.
Can I touch it?++++@++++Sure. Go for the gusto.
It's healing over my hand.++++@++++It knows you're afraid.
Yes, whatever, just take them!++++@++++Aw, aren't they sweet. Any medical things I should know about?
Why, Homer, your surgical incision is completely healed.++++@++++I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it.
Ah, yes. How is your day care center doing?++++@++++Wonderful. Being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. Ya got any?
I've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.++++@++++Peek-a-boo!
Uncle Homer, will you sing that crazy song we love?++++@++++Okay. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS / MY FRIEND / THEN LET'S KEEP DANCING...
Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better.++++@++++Yes, but then I discovered the joys of raising children.
What about us?++++@++++Don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. Then you'll know my joy.
I contributed by not objecting too much.++++@++++Aw, that's my girl.
Anyway, this film crew... will shoot some behind-the-scenes footage of your amazing work.++++@++++Is there a snack table?
It's already set up.++++@++++Don't film this.
We're just restin' our eyes.++++@++++'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...
Ow! You stepped on my arm!++++@++++Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
Tell me about the "Homer Cares" program.++++@++++My kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
Awww. Did you make 'em yourself?++++@++++Yes, through the magic of caring.
This year's winner of the "Saint Who Walks Among Us" award...++++@++++Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you don't...
... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Yes!
And he gambles like crazy.++++@++++I'll call.
Three nines.++++@++++I almost had a straight!
Come to new papa.++++@++++Hey, what's the deal?
We just spliced in some home movies. Whaddaya think?++++@++++Well, I'd rather reserve judgement until I... oh my God!
My polite indignation has no bounds.++++@++++No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
Where are we going?++++@++++Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty chocolate milkshakes!
Where are we going, Mr. Simpson?++++@++++I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
Then you better turn.++++@++++Uh oh.
Yeah. / Pretty much.++++@++++Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie.
The Teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.++++@++++Yeah, that'll happen.
You're next, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Hey, wait a minute. "Airport tax, five dollars?"
Sir, it's a standard fee.++++@++++Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it...
Mornin', folks.++++@++++What are you gonna do to us?
Well, I s'pose I could spin ya a few more yarns... But first, who wants to give me a sponge bath? I'm filthy.++++@++++All right, but your next story better be worth it.
Okay, ready for another impression? This is Southside Jake tearin' into Tin Can Tillie.++++@++++Oh, this'll be good.
Dad, you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo!++++@++++A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
And her family changed theirs to "Buffelkill."++++@++++I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J.
The buffalo are gone. I think you shot them all.++++@++++What have I done? What have I done?!
Yeah, I suppose you could grind some pills into it.++++@++++Aww...
Ooh, look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip.++++@++++Big deal.
And that was Tom and Huck's last adventure.++++@++++I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
I believe I told three stories.++++@++++I'll meet you in Wilmington.
You know, I do four hundred sit-ups a day.++++@++++Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird.
Oh, not at all. I like when people say nice things about my body.++++@++++And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?
BABIES, WHO WANTS-A BABIES...++++@++++Wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
I sense you live with much misery.++++@++++The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday.
I sense I should not take a check.++++@++++A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!
Get out.++++@++++So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
You've ruined me! Oh, why didn't I see this coming?++++@++++Hey, that's me. And that's you.
You stupid, stupid man! I curse you! You will bring bad luck to everyone you love!++++@++++What-ever.
Gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.++++@++++Good as new.
Yeah, but a lot harder to catch. Uh, go with the leprechaun.++++@++++Guys, I am not cursed!
Well, okay, but hurry up.++++@++++Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!
...ya big fat ass!++++@++++Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves.
Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.++++@++++Good idea, Mr. Ed. Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?
Ah, the cursed one. How's that curse I cursed you with, Cursed-y , hm?++++@++++I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, Irish-style!
Hold me close... kiss me I'm Irish...++++@++++Ew! Nasty!
The best thing about a gypsy wedding is I'm not the hairiest woman here.++++@++++Yep. Everything worked out for the best.
What? Bart is dead!++++@++++Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back.
The gypsy said it would.++++@++++She's not the boss of me.
Dinner is served.++++@++++Mm, various eggs.
Bravo, Pierce!++++@++++Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
Uh-huh. Absolutely. / Yep. /++++@++++Oh, I agree.
Homer, my dear fellow. You're carrying quite a bit of tension in your back fat, Homer.++++@++++Yeah, that's the price of success.
Can I top you off?++++@++++What's my blood alcohol?
Point one five.++++@++++Keep 'em comin'.
You know, Marge is quite a remarkable woman.++++@++++Yeah, she's cool.
You're certainly a lucky man to have her.++++@++++Lucky, shmucky. I knocked her up. But she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. But if I died, she'd be completely free. For man or machine.
Machine, eh?++++@++++Yep, a machine.
Homer! Homer, you're alive!++++@++++Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?
Dad, that's the water softener!++++@++++Well, I am missing the back of my head. I think you could cut me some slack.
Oh, how magical!++++@++++Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...
She'll be killed!++++@++++My sweet little angel!
Shazbot.++++@++++Hey, we stayed for your kids!
Oh-ho-ho. If our Wampum Wagon spots your KBBL Party Penguin, you'll win forty dollars!++++@++++Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!
Hey, there's the Wampum Wagon!++++@++++End of the line, boys.
Yes they are, Roy.++++@++++Judge Snyder? While we're young?
On the other hand, I was young once.++++@++++I'll bring the car around.
Don't spit on my cupcake and tell me it's frosting.++++@++++What'd she say about cupcakes?
According to this, your father was driving you to school? Then where was he when you stole the police car?++++@++++Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol.
You abandoned your son to win forty dollars?++++@++++And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
And that was more important than keeping your son out of trouble?++++@++++Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of "Don't Fear the Reaper", I think you'll agree that...
I'm familiar with B.O.C. But you have got a boy here who is crying out for adult supervision.++++@++++I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
Sorry, Bub. That crow won't caw.++++@++++It won't?
I hereby order you to be tethered to your son.++++@++++Tethered?!
Tethered. Report to room five.++++@++++Room five?!
There we go. How's that?++++@++++It's a little tight.
Sir, you are not a size four.++++@++++I used to be.
Well, maybe it'll be fun. You'll get to spend more time together. Make sure your father takes his mood medication.++++@++++I'll medicate you...
Today we're going to talk about predicates and predicate nominatives.++++@++++Bo-ring.
Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach.++++@++++Come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff.
Will you please just go back to sleep?++++@++++Fine.
Night terrors, ma'am.++++@++++Cobras!
Hurry up, Dad!++++@++++I'm with you, son!
Wow, my first home run.++++@++++That's my boy...
Can I ask you something, Dad?++++@++++Sure, boy.
The town keeps getting bigger. Will there always be enough electricity?++++@++++Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?
Uh, I don't think Lenny's house has a steeple.++++@++++Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes...
Hey, hey. No kids in the bar.++++@++++Since when?
Oh, the heat's been on since them Bush girls were in here.++++@++++All right, all right. Come on, Bart.
I'm cold and scared.++++@++++That's my little slugger.
C'mon, Dad. Let's go.++++@++++Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!
All right. Hand 'em over.++++@++++Moe? What the?...
There's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to juvenile crime: punish the parents.++++@++++It's about time. Oh.
Granted. But you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for Bart. He might even make the honor roll, if Dad can control his night terrors.++++@++++Well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
C'mon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom.++++@++++Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.
Come on, Homer.++++@++++No!
Homer, just take him to the bathroom.++++@++++Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!
Would you mind? I'm trying to do my homework.++++@++++Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head.
Oh, Homie, no. We can't.++++@++++What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
I don't want him to see us expressing our love.++++@++++Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
The lady said no.++++@++++Hey, shut up.
You shut up.++++@++++Ow! Why you--!
What'd you do that for?++++@++++Because I... Ow! You--!
Ah!++++@++++Ow!
I'm sleeping in the bathtub.++++@++++Why you little...
She's such a butthole.++++@++++We're free! Your mother set us free!
That's right. It's me, Judge Harm, through the magic of fiber optics.++++@++++Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha.
Quiet, Tubsy. You violated my order.++++@++++But, Constance, it only happened because...
You two need to wake up and smell the java. And the first step is to admit that you're bad parents.++++@++++I admit it.
You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids.++++@++++Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately.
Not yet. No. Today the judge wants you to bend over so people can spank you from their cars.++++@++++Well, that explains the sign.
I just can't do that, Homer. It's a matter of principle. And I need you to support me in this.++++@++++You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
I want goggles, too.++++@++++Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders...
Ahh!!++++@++++Hey, Marge, surf's up!
You're using my table saw to violate a court order?++++@++++Well, we tried all those other tools.
Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as...++++@++++Woo hoo!
If that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious.++++@++++Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking.
Concentrate, Homer.++++@++++This address must be wrong.
No. No, there it is!++++@++++She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool.
We hate her, Homer.++++@++++I know, I know. Fight the power.
Let's do this thing.++++@++++Cops!
And help me with this banner.++++@++++I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her.
She's gonna find us!++++@++++Oh Lord, guide this cinder block...
My house!++++@++++Hey, how ya doin'?
That quilt was made by my grandmother.++++@++++So... it cost you nothin'.
We promise.++++@++++That was close.
What's that noise?++++@++++Just the radio, dear.
What are you reading, Homie?++++@++++The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never know what he'll do next. Hm... Aw. Look at that dad in "Drabble." He's like an unfunny version of me.
That's odd. He's outside, digging.++++@++++Probably digging for drugs.
There's no drugs out there.++++@++++No. Of course not.
Go for it.++++@++++Maybe I will.
What's stopping you?++++@++++Very little.
But Morlocks are from the future.++++@++++You callin' me a liar, Carl?
Yeah. How'd you know the Chinese were spyin' on ya?++++@++++Oh, I just naturally assumed.
Ah, quitcher bellyaching, coffee boy. You're lucky I let ya in here.++++@++++Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately.
You take that back.++++@++++Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us.
But, can you blame me? Every day it's the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin' tip.++++@++++Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
Ah, who am I kiddin'? I ain't smiled for real since I nailed that rat with the ice pick. Ha, remember that?++++@++++That was an amazing throw.
Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger.++++@++++Hey, where'd that painting come from?
But who'll run the bar while you're gone?++++@++++Ooh, ooh, pick me!
... And if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell.++++@++++Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
Hey, what are you doin'? I gotta pay for that!++++@++++No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.
All right, look, I-I gotta go.++++@++++I thought you said you had to go.
Hey Homer, do you mind if I bring in some outside food?++++@++++Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?
Sorry. Sorry.++++@++++For what? A little splattered food never hurt anybody. Now everybody shut up and dance!
Hey, what happened to the music?++++@++++Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.
Are you gonna be okay?++++@++++Ayyy.
But, where are the bar stools?++++@++++Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?
Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.++++@++++I don't get it.
Yell out "I'll eat a booger."++++@++++What's the gag?
Hey, Homer stop, stop! It's me! Geez.++++@++++Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?
My Professor said if I prettied up this dump, it would renew my zeal.++++@++++And it would look pretty, too.
I am Formico. The Dean of Design.++++@++++Hi, Formico.
Ah, ah, ah! My name must never be spoken.++++@++++Sorry. He seems nice.
Just leave the bottle.++++@++++There you go, doll.
Wow, check out the new Moe's.++++@++++Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up.
Uh, looks like a long wait to get in.++++@++++Not for friends of Moe's.
Is your name on the list?++++@++++Don't you know who I am?
It's okay, Cecil. They're VIPs.++++@++++Cecil is a girl's name.
Yeah, ya like it, Homer?++++@++++Um... the rabbits are cute.
Ain't it trippy?++++@++++Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
We don't serve Duff no more. We got a Malaysian beer that's better than Duff... It's made outta soy sauce.++++@++++Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff.
Models?! Ha. Oh boy!++++@++++Okay, look cool.
This is creative design run amok!++++@++++That's it!
And "penis" is Russian for...++++@++++Moe, we want our bar back.
Eh, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in your dark spot.++++@++++Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony.
Is it? Oh, well that's it. That's-- Dagmar, Julian, throw this bum out.++++@++++I'll throw myself out, thank you.
Whatcha doin', Dad?++++@++++I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.
This is pretty far to go just to spite Moe.++++@++++It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
Running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.++++@++++But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end.
I WON'T DRINK AT MOE'S / HOMER'S OLD GARAGE IS ALL I NE-ED / I WON'T DRINK AT MOE'S...++++@++++'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!
That calls for another beer.++++@++++Barkeep!
I thought this was gonna be your bar.++++@++++It's the family bar. Right, kids?
Can we go to bed now?++++@++++As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
But you're not even using them.++++@++++She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee.
How'd you get REM to play in your garage?++++@++++I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.
What the-- You can't open your own bar!++++@++++Seems to me I already did.
But it's illegal! You can't run a bar in a private residence.++++@++++Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law "to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."
Ah, here we go. It also says, "a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."++++@++++Which I'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy.
Hunting? Dad, no!++++@++++Lemons...
It's not fair, Dad. Why should an animal die just because you and Moe are fighting?++++@++++It's the law. My hands are tied.
Do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?++++@++++I would.
You do? Then I like you, too. Here, have a towelette.++++@++++Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey...
You did it, Moe!++++@++++A cougar! Die, cougar!
My leg! Aww, geez!++++@++++Got that cat right in the leg.
Dad, you shot Moe!++++@++++Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!
Aw, I'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar.++++@++++Hey, who invited the hippies?
I did. You owe REM an apology for, eco-fraud.++++@++++All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest.
Oh, come on, Bart. Smell those curds! Mmmmm, curds.++++@++++And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender.
Ah, here you go, pal.++++@++++And here you go.
Fortune cookie.++++@++++Ah. And now to read my fortune. "Geese can be troublesome." What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Oh... Fortune means: Geese cause problems.++++@++++Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that.
Every house has a bathroom.++++@++++Oh, these fortunes are terrible.
Is there a problem?++++@++++These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness.
Well, with all due respect, sir, I suppose you could come up with better fortunes?++++@++++Easy.
Show them.++++@++++Okay, let's see... "The price of stamps will climb ever higher."
Please, Yung Mee was a hack compared to this guy.++++@++++Let's see. "You will invent a humorous toilet lid." "You will find true love on Flag Day." "Your store is being robbed, Apu." Are you getting all this, Lisa?
I'm sorry, Monty...++++@++++Stop that dog! It has my gum!
Look, there's one of my young chums now. You there!++++@++++Yes, Mr. Burns.
Tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.++++@++++Ummm...
Play along, Chubsy. There's a pie in it for you.++++@++++Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
Where did you get that pie?++++@++++Windowsill.
New underpants? Homer, what are you up to?++++@++++Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go.
Well, don't look too hip. You don't want that girl falling for you.++++@++++You're right.
D-- Oh, uh, constantly. When we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! Eh, pally?++++@++++Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns.
Put my hand on her knee.++++@++++Yes, Mr. Burns.
I said her. And I said knee.++++@++++Oh, sorry.
I'm going to make such love to you that, oh, you'll forget all about Rudolph Valentino. Turn left here.++++@++++No problem.
All right, you're dismissed. I'll take it from here.++++@++++But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.
Did you hear that? That "excellent" was... excellent.++++@++++Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine.++++@++++You're going to ask her to marry you?!
Isn't it wonderful? I'm head over heels in love.++++@++++Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
Monty! It's beautiful.++++@++++Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
My ring!++++@++++Let go of her or I'll scream!
Uh-un.++++@++++Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape.
Don't say that, baby. I'm gonna win you back if I have to pistol whip this guy all night.++++@++++Pistol whip?!
Let me guess. Now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. You Are so predictable.++++@++++You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.
Wow, you don't get it.++++@++++Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?
I swear I can change, Gloria. I'm taking classes in computer fraud.++++@++++Hmm...
I don't like bothering people at home.++++@++++Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
I know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say "Channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."++++@++++Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?
Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart.++++@++++What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.
I don't get it, Simpson. I'm a bad boy.++++@++++Oh, I know.
What do I have to do? Grow a devil beard?++++@++++You mean a Van Dyke?
Burly. You're so rugged and manly...++++@++++Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear.
Fantasize, Marge. Fantasize about Burly.++++@++++Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey...
"Dear Burly, comma, I've never written to a registered trademark before. Are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? In either case, I would love a signed photo. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."++++@++++Love? "Signed photo"?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!
Person-to-person?!++++@++++Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels.
How did you get my number?++++@++++I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?
Oh, my goodness...++++@++++Perfect. I'll be there at seven.
Playing a prankeroo, eh?++++@++++I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?
You're not going to believe it. That paper towel lumberjack is coming here! For dinner! Tonight!++++@++++Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up.
Oh my God!++++@++++Why look, it's Chad Sexington!
Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.++++@++++It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her.
I suggest dinner and a show.++++@++++How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?
I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.++++@++++Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.
Hey, smart move, four-eyes. Sittin' next to Skeletor here makes you look like Hercules.++++@++++Zing! What's a Skeletor?
Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?++++@++++Do me! Do me!
When I snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian.++++@++++Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!
Thank you. Now you are... Emily Dickinson.++++@++++Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!
Now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old...++++@++++I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!
Ah, yes, yes. Um...++++@++++Oh, that's better...
Well, is anything coming back to you?++++@++++Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
Try to remember back when you were twelve. Something frightening must have happened.++++@++++Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys.
And there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. I mean, who likes getting muddy? It's terrible. Okay, let's go to Moe's now.++++@++++Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming...
Fine. Crap all over my theory.++++@++++Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
You found a corpse when you were twelve? No wonder you've been so traumatized.++++@++++It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses...
Oh. Okay. Well, we'll just be going, then.++++@++++Oh, hey, you guys can come with us.
Oh... Oh, okay. Well, uh, I'll see ya.++++@++++Bye, Moe.
Stop saying that, Dad.++++@++++Never!
Maybe we should come back in the daytime.++++@++++Someone's yellow belly is showing.
Ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart.++++@++++And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
It's the body!++++@++++And someone has eaten the flesh.
With this film.++++@++++Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!
Ha, busted!++++@++++Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though.
Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?++++@++++Why? He'd just bury it.
Oh. Well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?++++@++++Seems kinda pointless now.
Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned.++++@++++Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.
You know it is.++++@++++WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD.
Hey Dad, will you help me build this model rocket?++++@++++Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts.
I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.++++@++++Science!?
Uh, he didn't say science... he said "pie pants."++++@++++Mmmm, pie pants.
Over here, Guv'nor.++++@++++The word "unblowupable" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence...
Wow, did you see that yaw control?++++@++++I have eyes, don't I?
Well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?++++@++++Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good.
Oh, that's sensible.++++@++++Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God.
Dad, the rocket's off course!++++@++++Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds...
Now it's headed for the church.++++@++++Don't worry, I planned for this.
This is the worst thing you've ever done.++++@++++You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
Why does Jesus have a lasso?++++@++++'Cause he's all man.
That's it!++++@++++Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!
Oh no...++++@++++I don't know how to feel.
You should be very upset.++++@++++Got it.
Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over...++++@++++Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy.
I'm a Buddhist.++++@++++Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
Just do it. Do it. Do it now!++++@++++I think this tree could use an angel.
Well, Santa can take it back because I'm not ruled by material desi-- Is that a pony?++++@++++I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.
More sugar, please.++++@++++Bag's in the kitchen.
Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys.++++@++++So you're back on the winning team?
Oh. We'd better stay inside. At least until the squirrels stop melting.++++@++++No problem. There's plenty of activities inside.
He smelled like puke!++++@++++The TV!
Hey, where'd they go?++++@++++New shooter.
That's it, baby. Welcome to Marvin Gardens.++++@++++Oh, we'll see about that.
You're a little light here, Dad.++++@++++I'm good for the rest, you know I am.
Well, I'd like to trust you, Homer. But you've been in jail three times.++++@++++They told me it would be like this on the outside.
Who else is gonna take care of her? Dad?++++@++++Why you little...
And we carried it out as a family!++++@++++Police brutality! And chew-tality!
Take it back! Take it back!++++@++++Stanford.
Hello, I'm Gabriel.++++@++++A heavenly choir. You must be an angel!
No, that's my pager. I'm a social worker. I'm here to help you stop fighting and become a family again.++++@++++No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in "The Preacher's Wife," or Will Smith in "Bagger Vance," or Slimer in "Ghostbusters."
Sir, we know you're not an angel. My husband sees too many movies.++++@++++Don't blame me, blame Tinseltown and its second golden age. May it never end.
Homer, I am not an angel!++++@++++Well, not with that temper.
Homer, your problem is quite simple. You're a drunken, childish buffoon.++++@++++...Which is society's fault because...
It's your fault, Homer. But I've got an exercise that will help all of you break out of the roles you're stuck in. Who feels like lunch?++++@++++Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please.
You'll just have to cooperate.++++@++++Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.
...And plenty of beer.++++@++++Gimme that beer!
We've got to do something, but what?++++@++++Okay, family huddle.
Look, we can't fall into old patterns. We've gotta think of a plan.++++@++++Okay, but talk like this.
Fine, I'll talk like this.++++@++++What?
Give them the food!++++@++++Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!
Give them the beer! It will impair their motor skills!++++@++++No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz.
WE ARE FAMILY!++++@++++WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!
Well, I think you all did great. You broke out of your normal roles to accomplish something as a family. I've really earned my wings.++++@++++I knew it!
You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger.++++@++++Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
Homer and Ned, you may now kiss your brides.++++@++++Give it to me, baby.
You and Ned married a couple floozies?++++@++++Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me.
If I Had known there were loose women in Las Vegas, I would never have let you go.++++@++++Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you.
Get out, Homer.++++@++++Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee.
Now, now, Momma's gonna make you a snack.++++@++++Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah...
Oh, no. She's making him a sandwich.++++@++++Use both hands...
Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?++++@++++Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?
Bigamy.++++@++++Not a sports fan, huh?
You insensitive jerk! Maybe this family would be better off without you!++++@++++You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!
Why don't you just take Britney Beers and get outta here!++++@++++I would if it wasn't for the kids.
We had a good run.++++@++++Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's.
Gee, Homer. Your new wife is great. Her lips look like night-crawlers.++++@++++You know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face.
Wowww.++++@++++To Amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
Oh, sure. He paid for the hour.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?++++@++++I don't know.
It's got pictures of deformities.++++@++++Okay.
It was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.++++@++++She said "tavern". I'm going to Moe's!
All right. Outside.++++@++++Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen.
Wow, that's the best book I've ever seen!++++@++++No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's "Op Center."
Francis of Assisi .++++@++++I've used up all these records.
Why don't you try to set a record, Dad?++++@++++That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
Only on Mars.++++@++++The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else.
Three years.++++@++++Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra.
Uh, technically, the cobra would get the record. He's the one playing.++++@++++But it's my banjo.
Mr. Simpson, there are thousands of people like you with no discernible talent.++++@++++Yeah, they're called "Congress".
Shut up.++++@++++Okay.
All the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. The only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt.++++@++++Group stunt?
Like that town that made the world's largest omelet.++++@++++Denver?
/ What's he talking about?++++@++++We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
I haven't seen this much flesh since Elke Sommers' hot-tub party. Seriously, Elke's great. Always there for sick kids. Doin' great things.++++@++++Okay. Lemme check the specs.
Yeah, Dad! You can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!++++@++++Why you little!
Everyone, welcome to the Duff Book Of World Records: Springfield is the World's Fattest Town!++++@++++Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!
You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit.++++@++++Yeah, you can't improve on nature.
If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture.++++@++++Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?
What are you talking about? Is that dinner?++++@++++It was dinner.
Why didn't you just turn off the oven?++++@++++I was hoping we could do that together.
Silence! I rule in favor of Marge Simpson.++++@++++Oh, I am so proud of you.
And, thanks to Marge's Simpson's damning evidence... I hereby ban all sugar products from Springfield -- forever!++++@++++Get in the car.
I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.++++@++++Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine.
Mr. Simpson, you are licking blood and Vapo-Rub.++++@++++Part of me knew that.
There is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. By any means necessary.++++@++++I'm with you all the way. But first...
Gentlemen, I have found the final member of our cabal.++++@++++Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
Homer, we need you to help us smuggle in sugar from south of the border.++++@++++Oh, you mean Tennessee?
There is the island!++++@++++I'm only doin' this one more time.
I think he's grossed-out by some seaweed.++++@++++Eww. I touched it. Over.
Get a grip, Simpson. You're doing fine. Now, do you have your map?++++@++++Kinda.
Okay man, there's the sugar. Now you give us the money.++++@++++That wasn't part of the deal!
Well, we're almost home.++++@++++Has everyone keistered their personal supply?
Surrender or prepare to be sunk.++++@++++No way! We'll defy you to the death!
No, I'm having one!++++@++++Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?
Good work, Simpson.++++@++++Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa.
Mm. I guess you just can't use the law to nag. Maybe I should just stop trying to change the world.++++@++++No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich.
That's the best one!++++@++++That's what I told Lisa!
Ooh, a salute to brunch! Wave to brunch, Maggie!++++@++++Look at those abs.
Uh-oh, the professor said not to let him get a boner.++++@++++I'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. Show the movie!
Homer, you're going to get in trouble.++++@++++I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they gonna do? Advance on me?
Litter is my most treacherous foe. I would like to eat its children.++++@++++So long, suckers!
Homer, you've suffered a broken jaw.++++@++++Broken jaw?
But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.++++@++++Mm hmm.
This has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.++++@++++I'm horny!
Homer, your breath smells terrible. I'll have to take off my shoes to cover the odor.++++@++++Nicely done.
Uh, hey, how ya doin'?++++@++++I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
I'm an alcoholic. Homer, will you appear on my show?++++@++++Sure thing, Alky.
Well, he would eat all the time. We'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of Hershey's Miniatures.++++@++++Krackle was my favorite.
He did such crazy things -- roll clip.++++@++++Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!
I'll take one.++++@++++Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death.
Do you promise not to wevive your weckless, weckless ways?++++@++++Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month...
Please, Homie? No more craziness -- for me?++++@++++Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert.
Hm, all clean, just the way I left it.++++@++++I'm gonna kill you!
We're rehearsing a play.++++@++++Yes, and I was merely reading the title: "I'm gonna kill you."
Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.++++@++++Professor Van Doren, so good to see you.
This place is so dull. The nine-one-one button is covered with dust.++++@++++I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?
It's seven-thirty!++++@++++Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey.
The Demolition Derby? That'll scratch my itch.++++@++++Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...
Dad, you've gotta do something.++++@++++But bold moves are no longer my forte!
She could get hurt!++++@++++Oh, what do I do? What do I do?
A man on a donkey! Never in my six weeks on the job have I seen the likes of this.++++@++++Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.
This family needs a live wire, but it's just not me.++++@++++That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket. The kind I like wrapped around me.
Let's approach with caution!++++@++++Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
Pretty much. Yeah.++++@++++What's goin' on?
Oho! Trouble in paradise.++++@++++Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya.
Homer, Marge, I have a rather delicate proposition.++++@++++Spill it, moneybags.
Yes, I do have everything. But yet I often wonder what life with Marge would have been like.++++@++++It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs.
Homer, I will give you one million dollars to let me spend a weekend alone with your wife.++++@++++Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much sex would be involved? 'Cause if it's "some"...
Besides, I like some of the noises you make in bed.++++@++++One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
Wow! Homer, that was amazing.++++@++++Yeah, I...
Are you snoring while you're awake?++++@++++Uh huh.
And you get more sprawl space on the bed.++++@++++Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?
Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe.++++@++++Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late.
You're not on the guest list, Simpson. Orders of Prom King Ziff. And have you been drinking?++++@++++Just for twenty-five years.
Oh yeah, make me the bad guy.++++@++++My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?
Sounds like a plan.++++@++++Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
Homer was there?++++@++++I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me.
But I can explain!++++@++++I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma.
I carved that one wonderful summer.++++@++++What did Carl think?
I'll put you on rig thirteen, as soon as they burn off the corpses.++++@++++This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love.
Looks like we're goners. Oh well, circle of life.++++@++++Marge?!
Ain't ya comin', Homer?++++@++++Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.
But, Homer...++++@++++We said "Good day"!
Listen to me, Homer. You've won. You own Marge's heart. And that's something I could never buy.++++@++++Woo hoo!
We can't take his money.++++@++++Oh, I can't take his money... I can't print my own money... I have to work for money... Why don't I just lie down and die?
Goodnight, Homie.++++@++++Goodnight, honey.
For God's sake, Homer. Give them back their flame!++++@++++No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
You can always find your favorite shows next month.++++@++++You wait 'til next month! You wait 'til next month!
"Springfield Preparatory School?!" Dad, you told me there were no private schools in Springfield!++++@++++But knowing about it would make you want to go here.
Hello, and thank you for coming to our fund-raiser. I'm Headmaster St. John Van Hookstratten.++++@++++Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?
Monkeys point.++++@++++Monkeys cry.
No, I belong here! Pleeeaaase!++++@++++Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is.
I will not be a Gamecock!++++@++++You will too!
It's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.++++@++++Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like "jumbo" or "boxcar" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy...
That car's as big as all outdoors.++++@++++Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?
Homer, I see your daughter is one of those whale-kissing, Dukakis-hugging moon maidens.++++@++++Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool.
I just want my daughter to be happy. Plus you eat the pretzels I drop on the floor.++++@++++That I do, sir.
Yeah, I guess.++++@++++DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
Oh, that's just Lara Flynn Boyle.++++@++++I have a Boyle on my ass.
And where were you?++++@++++Cockfight.
...so to win Greta back, I have to go to Toronto.++++@++++Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?
Maggie, what do you think?++++@++++All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!
Dad, no. It says "don't walk"!++++@++++Doesn't matter. They have free health care.
Oh, you'll win her back, eh. And B, we're closing in five minutes.++++@++++Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
The geek shall inherit the earth.++++@++++There she is, boy.
I don't know, Dad. What if she's still mad at me?++++@++++Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back.
But she might say no.++++@++++Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gonna take a nap.
Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless.++++@++++Oh, right.
A crazy dog's trying to kill me!++++@++++Really? Ooh, this I gotta see.
So Bart, when does the killing start?++++@++++He's a good doggie!
Well, right now, I'm supposed to be in school.++++@++++Just you wait!
I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.++++@++++Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?
Buck gave it to me. He's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him.++++@++++No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks.
Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.++++@++++It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food...
Aw, Homie, you'll always be my western hero.++++@++++Swell.
Dad, why are you wearing that?++++@++++Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.
Gee Buck, your old films are as violent as today's!++++@++++One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.
SIR YOU CANNOT PEE / UNLESS YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE...++++@++++CAN'T KEEP IT IN...
Boy, that's some fancy shootin'.++++@++++I've seen fancier.
Live, from the corner of Zany Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, it's the Krusty the Clown show. With special guest Buck McCoy. And now, here's Krusty!++++@++++Oh, listen to you. "Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. " How old are you?
He's drunk!++++@++++I've seen drunker.
Did I forget to mention I'm an alcoholic?++++@++++For shame!
That is just grotesque.++++@++++Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?
Eh, we could try it.++++@++++Yes!
You care about Bart's feelings.++++@++++Stop saying that.
Seventy-six.++++@++++Nice old man. Don't break a hip.
Buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever.++++@++++Mmmm, something smells delicious.
Ah, please, everyone, stay away. We don't want anyone to be a hero. A hero. A hero!++++@++++Get me Buck McCoy.
Are you crazy? I'm a movie cowboy. And you're no Howard Hawks.++++@++++That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
Not to mention this.++++@++++Dad!
Buck, you're my hero again.++++@++++Aren't you forgettin' someone?
Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, America's firefighters and then you, Dad.++++@++++And don't you forget it.
Honey, I've got some bad news for you.++++@++++Not now, Marge. I'm waitin' for the new XFL season. Who will win this year's Million Dollar Game? Who? Who?
Honey...++++@++++The "X" is for extreme!
There is no XFL this year. The league folded.++++@++++Who told you?!
Homer, your father's dead!++++@++++And he never even lived to be a vegetable.
It's Grampa's smell. "Old Old Spice."++++@++++Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him.
But you were very open with your feelings.++++@++++Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was "in love" with him.
Me? I ain't dead. It was Stimson down the hall. So much for Mister "I can button my own shirt."++++@++++Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance.
Yeah, there's so many things we can...++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit.
B-6.++++@++++You sunk my Scrabbleship!
This game makes no sense.++++@++++Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
I wanna drive again!++++@++++You? No way. It's too dangerous.
Well, you're no angel behind the wheel. What about your D.U.I.?++++@++++That was a D.W.I.
Please, son. Driving is my last chance to feel alive.++++@++++Well, you brought me into this world, so no.
Fine, I'm dead.++++@++++Dad, get up.
Woo hoo! And I want driving gloves!++++@++++No way.
I got me a date with Zelda, so I need the car.++++@++++Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it.
Why don't we double date? Then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.++++@++++Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!
Cut it out. I can work the brakes myself.++++@++++No you can't.
Dude sure got his comeuppance.++++@++++In real life he would die.
Oh, Zelda.++++@++++Hey, watch the movie.
Oh, everybody trusts Lisa. Precious little Lisa, apple of her Daddy's eye.++++@++++Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
Grampa, I gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie.++++@++++Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive.
Shut up! You don't know her! Zelda loves me! I HATE THIS HOUSE!++++@++++Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.
He used to be such an angel. Maybe you should give him another chance.++++@++++No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn.
He is your dad.++++@++++Cosmic.
Death race?++++@++++And another thing: no death races!
First he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. Your father's out of control.++++@++++Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father.
So You've Settled for Branson.++++@++++We've gotta go after them.
Son, can you forgive an old fool?++++@++++Only in public.
Homer, you got a letter. Hm. It's from the library.++++@++++Overdue book?! This is the biggest frame-up since O.J. Wait a minute... blood in the Bronco... the cuts on his hand... those Jay Leno monologues... Oh my God, he did it!
Here's the book... "Classics for Children?"++++@++++Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day.
Why don't you read to us now?++++@++++I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?
No Dad. It's an epic tale from ancient Greece.++++@++++That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!
Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago.++++@++++Fine.
Hi-O-diddily-ysseus!++++@++++Stupid King of Troy. I think I speak for all the Greeks when I say this war has gone on for too long.
I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.++++@++++Anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. We hope you don't have a horse.
What are you laughing at, Dad?++++@++++If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... "As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."
Odysseus, do not forget to thank the gods for our victory with an appropriate animal sacrifice.++++@++++Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.
You gonna be askin' that the whole trip?++++@++++Gentlemen, I must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me.
THE FETA IS CHEESY / THE SIRENS ARE EASY...++++@++++Boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!
Oh, where could your father be?++++@++++Almost home!
Didn't you eat enough of your friends?++++@++++Those were my friends?!
Yes, I've been saying that for hours.++++@++++That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?
YOU'RE MY LA-DY / OF THE MOR-NING... /++++@++++This truly is Hell!
This is the face that launched a thousand ships. The other way!++++@++++Honey, I'm home!
Well, look who the Fates dragged in.++++@++++Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash.
Brave Odysseus, it has been twenty long years. Regale me with tales of your adventures.++++@++++Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.
It's never Joan Van Ark.++++@++++This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called "France..."
Victory.++++@++++Victory? We're French! We don't even have a word for it.
Don't burn her! She's just an innocent child!++++@++++Burn this guy! He lost our good bucket!
Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video.++++@++++Our next story is "Hamlet," by William Shakespeare.
Cool. Does he get to marry his Mom?++++@++++I don't know, but that would be hot. "Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark."
Could that fat ghost be telling the truth? First I've got to get Uncle Claudius to confess, then I've gotta kill him.++++@++++It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!
Are you crazy? I can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.++++@++++Son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. Called "Ghostbusters."
Now that's what I call a "moon shot."++++@++++Now that's what I call a moon shot.
Dad, that line was in the cartoon.++++@++++I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
Our phone bill is four hundred dollars! They charged us for a call to Brazil.++++@++++Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?
No sir, I didn't.++++@++++Choke on your lies!
Homer! They must have made a mistake. We'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.++++@++++Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.
We've been charged for calls to Brazil that we didn't make.++++@++++We are not paying this bill.
Fine, I'll cut off your service.++++@++++Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail.
Why must you fight with every utility?++++@++++I told you, I have too much time on my hands.
Homer, we were cleaning out a cooling duct at the plant and found a box of old taco shells!++++@++++Why didn't you call me?
Oh we tried. But a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats.++++@++++That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.
Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme...++++@++++Get me tools and beer.
What call to Brazil?++++@++++The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
You made that call? But you're the good one.++++@++++Yeah, the one we both like.
Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy.++++@++++Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.
He's so adorable. Can we have another baby?++++@++++No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
I am like sugar to them.++++@++++Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him.
Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now.++++@++++Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.
Except Antarctica.++++@++++The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil.
Okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer.++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?
Mm-hmm.++++@++++So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies...
No Dad, it's just the weather.++++@++++So hot snow falls up?
Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!++++@++++Forget every word, boy. It's useless.
Look, it's the giant statue of Christ on Corcovado.++++@++++Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.
It says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.++++@++++Way ahead of you, Marge.
Boy, they sure love soccer here.++++@++++Look Marge, I'm Brazilian.
How to Loot Brazil?++++@++++I got it, I got, I got it.
Look, the room came with a fruit hat.++++@++++Hey, and a mini-bar hat.
I'M CHIQUITA BANANA / AND I'M HERE TO SAY...++++@++++...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY!
While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found.++++@++++There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?
Yeah, check out the rats.++++@++++Ooh, they look like Skittles.
We're never gonna find him.++++@++++Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?
We nuns cannot fly.++++@++++Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?
You know I'm a vegetarian.++++@++++But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring!
Ah, si?++++@++++Does that include tip?
Excuse me, Americans...++++@++++How did you know?!
I feel so European.++++@++++Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well.
Just one, and it's across town.++++@++++Taxi!
My American friend, I'm afraid that this is a kidnapping.++++@++++So that means I don't have to pay the fare.
I'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation.++++@++++Fine. Take me, but let the boy go.
All right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?++++@++++Eh, same old garbage!
Oh, you two! We're eating genetically modified vegetables! Look how big they are.++++@++++This corn doesn't look so big.
That's baby corn.++++@++++What?!
I gotta admit, I-I'm kinda nervous, here. We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him.++++@++++I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons.
Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom.++++@++++It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder.
I'm sleeping on the couch.++++@++++Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself.
Caw! Caw!++++@++++We'll get to that. Right now, I think we need some time apart--
Caw! Caw! Caw!++++@++++All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Don't be mad at the crows, Homer. They weren't trying to blind you. They were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.++++@++++Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?
Well, there is a medication, although it's a little... controversial.++++@++++Does it go in the butt?
I'm talkin' about medicinal marijuana. Prescription pot. Texas T-H-C.++++@++++Look, man. I don't do drugs.
Homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic. You're not afraid, are you?++++@++++I had a bad experience with drugs...
Smell any drugs, Sgt. Scraps?++++@++++For me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight.
But Homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.++++@++++But isn't marijuana, or "dope," illegal?
It smells like the art teacher's office.++++@++++SMOKE ON THE WATER / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO
And now I'm guilty of possession! I could go to prison! Unless I testify against you...++++@++++Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal.
Dad, I thought you didn't like her saxophone.++++@++++I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...
Dad, it's one a.m. And I'm out of saliva.++++@++++Sh-sh-sh.
Hidilly-hey, Homer!++++@++++Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum.
Homer, i-i-it's me, Ned.++++@++++Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you.
Well, sir, of course He could... but then again... Wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle.++++@++++Now you know what I've been goin' through.
Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.++++@++++Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?
...The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The End.++++@++++Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.
Well, I know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.++++@++++Done and done. Now, do Wiggum.
Well, okay... I, I guess it would go something like this: All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?++++@++++I said Wiggum!
Smithers, I need someone who laughs at all my jokes. You know, honest feedback.++++@++++Oops! I thought this was the can, man.
Well, you're a Happy Homer. What's your name, young man?++++@++++You just said it!
Oh Smithers, I would have said anything to get your stem cells. Now, welcome aboard.++++@++++You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
Where did you get that suit?++++@++++Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?
Look, I'm really starting to worry. There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!++++@++++Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to "Yes-I-cannabis."
You mutton heads, this is why we can never hold down a job!++++@++++Look at Shemp! He is so high!
Whoa-ho-ho-ho. Hey, "Shemp" is "hemp" spelled backwards.++++@++++And "Otto" is "Otto" backwards.
Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?++++@++++As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here.
This just in: the Marijuana Re-Criminalization Initiative took another step forward today as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next Tuesday's election.++++@++++We gotta get out and stop that initiative. Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.
Thank you. And now, a man who's a real poth-ead ... I'm sorry, pothead... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs...
/ Jobs? / What?++++@++++'Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
/ Yes! Yes!++++@++++Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented "The Matrix," medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically.
What are we gonna do?++++@++++Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands.
Homie, you don't need drugs anymore. Your eyes are all better.++++@++++Eyes? What the hell are you talkin' about?
Homer, it's over. I want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again.++++@++++All right. I'll do it for my kids.
As long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house.++++@++++Never!
Yeah, I can still crash here, right?++++@++++Get out.
Remember when I dropped my keys and, and you thought the phone was ringin'?++++@++++Oh, yeah. Get out.
What's the matter, Homer? You're drunk but you're not like sloppy drunk.++++@++++Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
Dad, you just said that three minutes ago.++++@++++Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this.
Why are you keeping that thing?++++@++++As a reminder, Marge.
Ahoy-hoy, executive V.P. I'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors and I need your generous guffaws.++++@++++But I can't find you funny anymore.
I'm going to take a bathiola. When I come back, you'd better be laughing.++++@++++This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.
This suit used to belong to Judy Garland. Ah, we could sing a song if you don't mind being Mickey Rooney.++++@++++You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?
Oh, Mr. Burns! You were too beautiful for this world.++++@++++Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad.
The investors' meeting is in twenty minutes.++++@++++So what? Mr. Burns is dead.
two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?++++@++++Mr. Burns, may I field that one?
Yes, I regained consciousness during my big dance number. Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.++++@++++And you wanted to take him to the hospital.
What are you doing here anyway?++++@++++Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me.
Hey, hey, hey. I didn't ask for your life story.++++@++++Did you say "life story"?
Wow, tell me some more.++++@++++Don't you have criminals to catch?
Now, where were we?++++@++++My father and I were never really close.
Yeah. Hop in, Homer.++++@++++Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together...
Now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on.++++@++++All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed.
Hey Homer, do you remember this voice?++++@++++Kathleen Turner!
Where tonight we're roasting you, Homer Simpson!++++@++++Are the proceeds going to charity?
Hell no.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Now everyone knows Homer loves his family...++++@++++I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.
We will not destroy the Earth...one condition.++++@++++You name it.
Hm, all I need is one classic character...++++@++++Stupid lawn chair!
Don't you hate carpet stores that charge extra for the under-padding?++++@++++I hate them so much!
What's it to ya?++++@++++Why do people keep moving it... stupid...
That's opinion, not news!++++@++++That guy's hilarious. I especially like his white shirt and blue pants. Wait a second... Angry Dad is me!
Which makes you ten trillionth over-all.++++@++++What kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
You heard the freak!++++@++++Leave me alone!
How'd you like to be played by John Goodman?++++@++++That's just so obvious!
Dad, I'm no fan of Bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger.++++@++++I'm just passionate -- like all us Greeks.
No, you're angry. Look, you're punching the cat right now.++++@++++Oh, I am...
Congratulations, Dad. The first step is admitting it.++++@++++Is it also the last step?
If you ask me, you should give up fatty foods.++++@++++I said anger.
Homer? What's going on?++++@++++I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers.
Come on, Angry Dad. Get angry! Don't make me do a clip show!++++@++++Hello there, Flan-didly-danders.
Say it, don't spray it.++++@++++You're trying to get me angry, thank you.
You're not welcome.++++@++++I love you, boy.
Ha, ha, you love a boy.++++@++++Stop it now.
Welcome, steady customer. I see you are ready for the Civil War reenactment.++++@++++I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg.
I don't know which part of that sentence to correct first. But I cannot come. I work 22 hours a day, and then I go home to a wife who will not touch me. The Indian rope trick has become the Indian "nope" trick.++++@++++Hi-Yo!
The Squishee Lady!++++@++++Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?
Go ahead.++++@++++Grape.
Hey, she called me handsome!++++@++++She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
Come on, guys. We're gonna be late.++++@++++Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us.
Yeah, but I'm a recovering alcoholic, so...++++@++++One drink won't hurt.
Hey, you're right. I was afraid it would start me drinking again, but it didn't.++++@++++Mm-hmm!
The south will boogie again!++++@++++This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!
Oh the ny-lon has been released.++++@++++Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg.
Are you sure you can get your deposit back? It's in pretty bad shape.++++@++++Why do you always take the side of local merchants?
Apu is having an affair?!++++@++++Let's go.
How did you find out?++++@++++In my role as customer, I saw the whole thing.
No, no, no, let's just keep playing. What's the score?++++@++++Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock.
We have to do something to save that marriage. Maybe I should just tell Manjula. Or you could talk to Apu...++++@++++He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.
What would that accomplish?++++@++++That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.
That's sad. All those kids.++++@++++I think he's building to something.
I know, I know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. Yes. Homer, you did not bring me here for this. What is it that you want to tell me?++++@++++Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.
Here-here-here you go, mister.++++@++++Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash...
Is there something you want to tell me?++++@++++I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
It's true. It only happened once, but I am so ashamed. I am scum.++++@++++Yes. You are scum.
Oh, I always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore.++++@++++Mmm, caramel baloney.
Kids, we want to talk to you about something.++++@++++You might hear from your friends or co-workers that Apu isn't living at home anymore.
I just wish there was something we could do... Oh. Oh, Homer, are you thinking what I'm thinking?++++@++++You bet I am!
You can run, but you can't glide!++++@++++U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Tonight, we invite both Manjula and Apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming.++++@++++And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.
I keep telling you. Off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. But if we remind Apu and Manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems.++++@++++Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...
Even better.++++@++++This is going great.
Hey pally, uh... where do you want the Fudge Mahal?++++@++++Uh, we didn't order that.
I know a great nametag place. They do fabulous work.++++@++++It's where I got this!
Well, we had fun.++++@++++Hey, Apu, I think she likes you.
Ooh, a challenge!++++@++++Whee! Whee!
Wait a minute. This isn't on the list!++++@++++It's been on my list for a long time.
Not bad, eh?++++@++++I bought the issue for Richard Avedon's pictures of Lenny.
Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?++++@++++Woo!
"My Fair Lady," performed with all-octuplet cast... done.++++@++++It was magic. He took a Cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
Thank you very much, you big fat blabbermouth. I-- Sorry, sorry, it's been a rough month.++++@++++Here you go. Don't worry. I soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
Who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?++++@++++Well, hookers and Spiderman.
My little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.++++@++++Are you okay, Lisa?
Ich bin ein... gymnast!++++@++++Aww, she must have dreamt about Hitler again.
Whoa! Party house.++++@++++Hey, where's my keg?
Duh.++++@++++I TAKE A WHISKEY DRINK / I TAKE A CHOCOLATE DRINK / AND WHEN I HAVE TO PEE / I USE THE KITCHEN SINK / I SING THE SONG THAT REMINDS ME I'M A URINATING GUY!
My bubble, my rules.++++@++++That's it, boy! It's time for your bath!
Doogie Howser went to college when he was my age.++++@++++Against my wishes!
I put those "Cathys" on the fridge for you. I don't even like them. They've gotten so smutty.++++@++++Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But if a woman did it--
Homer, Cathy is a woman.++++@++++Oh, come on--
In the tree.++++@++++Right.
Oh, I cannot listen to this again.++++@++++Guys, I just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond.
Yeah, you must be some kind of marriage super-genius. How 'bout a few tips?++++@++++Certainly, Lenford. Make every day a celebration of your love. Surprise her with a pasta salad! Put a mini-beret on your wang!
Oh, I can't wait to see my surprise!++++@++++Hey, hey, hey, no peeking.
That caterpillar is screaming.++++@++++Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot.
...which has chosen your yard as its home.++++@++++Fine, I won't kill it.
"Screamapillar Care Tips." Wow, look at all this stuff. "Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."++++@++++Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?
What does he want now?++++@++++If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.
Put him down, boy! Put him down!++++@++++Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
Why don't I hear any screaming?++++@++++Uh, he's sleeping.
Then why don't I hear any sleep-screams?++++@++++Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...
Didn't these meals used to have a cobbler?++++@++++Uh, they discontinued the cobbler.
You smell like cobbler.++++@++++Now let's not get into who smells like what.
Oh, don't be such a nervous Purvis. That's not a real skeleton, it's a Halloween costume.++++@++++But what about the axe?
Oh, I couldn't possibly eat all this. Please join me.++++@++++Eh, you're the shut-in.
Oh Homer, I feel like I'm talking to Bennett Cerf.++++@++++Yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking.
Before you go, would you mind opening this jar of butter pickles?++++@++++My pleasure.
Oh my, you're as strong as you are handsome.++++@++++And I can ride my bike real fast.
Can I call you the next time I need a muscular he-man?++++@++++Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted.
Freshen your drinks, ladies?++++@++++Laxative?
I am so sick of doing her dirty work. She's taking advantage of us, Homer.++++@++++The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.
That man took my diamond necklace.++++@++++Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
Oh my gosh, she's dead.++++@++++Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.
So let me get this straight. This mysterious "man with braces" just stabbed the old lady and disappeared?++++@++++Without a trace.
I found her will, Chief. It was just changed to leave the Simpsons fifty thousand dollars.++++@++++Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially.
No, nah, it never does.++++@++++Book 'im, Lou.
Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?++++@++++You'd be dead a million times.
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better.++++@++++Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer.
Right away, sir. I-I-I don't want no trouble.++++@++++I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
Up-bup-bup. You didn't say you'd kill me.++++@++++I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
I insist on searching every inch of this home personally.++++@++++Here's my underwear drawer.
Oh Homer, what are we going to do?++++@++++You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you.
I can't believe we've been arrested for murder.++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!
But we're innocent! It was the man with the braces.++++@++++Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.
I'm also your host. Now let's meet a ghost!++++@++++Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
It's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...++++@++++Just think of them as twinkling stars.
Homie, I'm sorry. I can't. I just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. The kids growing up, grandchildren...++++@++++I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.
My love. You saved my life.++++@++++Now you do it for me.
You're on "Frame-Up"!++++@++++What?!
Only me, Carmen Electra!++++@++++I knew it!
Frame Up is Fox's latest hit! Right after "No Pants Island" and "Fart Date."++++@++++This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry.
We were in the Green Room. I had so much shrimp!++++@++++Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings.
Uh Homer, my face is up here.++++@++++I've made my choice.
Hey hey! Hey...++++@++++So hot, so sticky...
Dad, no. We're trying to conserve energy.++++@++++Lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!
JINGLE BELL, JINGLE BELL, JINGLE BELL RO...++++@++++Jingle bell what?
Dad, it's a blackout.++++@++++A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.
Look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... They're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. Please can I throw one little...++++@++++No.
What if I just burn down a...++++@++++No.
Can't I at least incite further...++++@++++No! I've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.
Can I have a beer?++++@++++All right, but not the imported.
I don't care what they say. I won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.++++@++++Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.
Homer, this is all your fault. If you hadn't plugged in your dancing Santa, none of this would have happened.++++@++++I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this.
Mom, Dad, someone stole my Malibu Stacy collection!++++@++++Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?
Oh, forget it. They couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing.++++@++++See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid.
Dad, that's Bart.++++@++++Exactly.
Maybe we should look for clues.++++@++++You're right. What's this?
Maybe.++++@++++People with heads?
Dude... I need a new cap.++++@++++Did you steal dolls from my daughter?
I think they demean women.++++@++++Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie.
But I just got out of juvie.++++@++++Good, 'cause I need directions.
Well, you'll be happy to know Malibu Stacey's fine. I really appreciate what you did, Dad.++++@++++Aw...
You said you'd do something, and you followed through on it.++++@++++Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around.
Oh, that's it.++++@++++Cheese!
Homer, you are so brave. If anyone deserves to take a penny, it is you.++++@++++Oh, well... Heh, heh. Hm... oh, I'll... no....
If you like protecting people, you could make that your job. You know, start a security company.++++@++++Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people.
Well, who would my partner be?++++@++++How 'bout Lenny?
No way!++++@++++You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.
Well, nice work, Inspector Find-It. Did you catch the thief?++++@++++Who said it was a he?
Well, I sure didn't.++++@++++Who said you did?
Okely-dokely.++++@++++You're pushing your luck, pal.
A monster!++++@++++Is this you? If it is, don't dial nine one one. Simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two.
Help me, SpringShield!++++@++++Have no fear, SpringShield's present!
Friend?++++@++++The only friend you need is SpringShield.
That commercial is very effective.++++@++++You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover.
Hey officer Homer, how'd you get so big and strong?++++@++++Green vegetables and homework.
Homie, to honor Springfield's newest hero, I made you your favorite dinner. All three courses are dessert.++++@++++Even dessert?
You can let me go, but I'll just keep exposing myself at the mall.++++@++++What a character.
Dad, make him stop!++++@++++Well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth.
Hurry up, boys. We gotta get these "toy poodles" to the pet shop.++++@++++All right, Fat Tony. Your little game is over.
Radar Love.++++@++++If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song.
I'm with you, Homer.++++@++++Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else? What about you, Dr. Hibbert?
Sorry Homer. I'm a coward now, like all recovering alcoholics.++++@++++After everything I did you're going to abandon me?
Homie, please. Why don't you just leave town?++++@++++What, and let them come after you and the kids?
We could come with you.++++@++++In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
You are listing my broken dreams.++++@++++I don't get it. I finally did a job where I wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now I'm gonna get killed for it.
Any last words, Simpson?++++@++++Yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. And if you kill him, someone'll take his place. And that's pretty much the end of it. The town'll be yours.
Oh Homie, I'm so glad you're alive!++++@++++Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see.
Well then, who shot all the gangsters?++++@++++I must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
Hm. Time to check in on our little sweetie pie.++++@++++Aw, she's taking a nap.
Yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot Mr. Burns.++++@++++She's just like Clark Kent. When there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. Nighty-night, sweetie.
My favorite is number three!++++@++++Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off.
Those were for the church breakfast.++++@++++Were they now?
Get your hammocks!++++@++++The hammock man! I'm glad he's a little early today.
The price is ten dollars, but I MUST warn you, this is no ordinary hammock. Its webbing is a mesh of comfort... and evil.++++@++++You had me at comfort.
Beer... for me?++++@++++No, you've got chores to do.
Chores? Me need clone.++++@++++Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.
But of course.++++@++++I mean, four!
Say Homer, I was, uh, I was wondering if I could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me.++++@++++Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.
No problem! Discover okay?++++@++++Ned...
Homie, I must say you have the energy of twenty men lately.++++@++++Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart and girl it up with Lisa.
I do!++++@++++Anybody else?
Dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?++++@++++You'd think so, but no.
They look like you, they were rude to Patty and Selma, and the horde has been described as "very gassy."++++@++++Yeah, it's a good group.
Good God, we're doomed!++++@++++Noooo!
The horde is almost dead! There's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning.++++@++++Good news.
...Twenty eight, twenty nine... There's one missing.++++@++++Not Mr. Blasty?
PLEASE DON'T HURT OUR FAMILY.++++@++++Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break.
I very much doubt that, Homer. These are horrible ghouls from the past.++++@++++Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --
Pardon the grabbing, but I've perfected a device that could save us all... a time machine. We can go back to the past and save our guns.++++@++++Gimme!
...poor William Bonney might have become a doctor, or a Senator...++++@++++Hear me, people of the past!
Hey everyone, that's us!++++@++++I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!
Dad, what are you doing?++++@++++Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!
Tell me again why we're spending our vacation on "The Island of Lost Souls"?++++@++++Hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?
Now he may try to slobber on your crotch.++++@++++Hey, I've been around Scotsmen.
Homer, someone's in trouble!++++@++++Hey, I'm on vacation.
Homie, something very creepy is going on here.++++@++++You mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?
I think I'm going to do a little sleuthing.++++@++++Bring back some ice.
Hate to be a needy Neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?++++@++++Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned.
Oh, c'mon Homer. All I'm asking is for you to yank my teats and harvest my milk.++++@++++Fine.
Oooh, that's nice. You're actually quite gentle when you want to be.++++@++++You know, you're not helping.
Shhh. Hey.++++@++++What's that?
Oooh, a toenail!++++@++++I can't believe it. Hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!
Hey Dad, check it out!++++@++++Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...
We were just playing.++++@++++What game?
Let's eat Maggie.++++@++++Manimals, invertebroads! You must fight back against the one who did this to you!
Wait a minute. I'm at work. Ya gotta pay for it.++++@++++What the-- Where's my money?
I'm afraid so.++++@++++And you can live with that.
Yuh-huh.++++@++++Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
Are you gonna buy those toads or just lick 'em?++++@++++Lick 'em. Go away.
Thanks for the donation, Mr. Simpson. Do you feel okay?++++@++++Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish.
Yeah, I guess I got caught up in all the glitz and glamour.++++@++++Well, Moe...
Homer, I'm so sorry. Have a free beer.++++@++++Oh.
Homer, can you say the alphabet backwards?++++@++++Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya...
Hey, I'm worried.++++@++++I've had just about enough of you.
Ah, rats.++++@++++I'm outta here...
Get his keys!++++@++++Hey, you want my keys?
Where to, Pal?++++@++++Moe's Tavern.
Homie, it's five p.m. We're having dinner.++++@++++What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?
No, it was the night you got loaded at Moe's and the car had to be towed home.++++@++++If I was that drunk, I would remember it.
It's true. I couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. I had to tell Mr. Burns you had violent diarrhea.++++@++++Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
Do you remember how you got home last night, Dad?++++@++++Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail.
There's no light rail in Springfield.++++@++++Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?
I will, Dad.++++@++++And that's why you're my favorite.
Another proud moment for the Simpsons.++++@++++I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.
Oh, you big fooler. Pretending not to remember so you could surprise us.++++@++++Yeah, I'm pretty great...
I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know...++++@++++That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
So whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye...++++@++++Oh, I can't believe they took "Monkey Trauma Center" off for this.
So I'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!++++@++++A hot babe...
Have you always resented us, Dad?++++@++++Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go...
Sorry we ruined your life, Homer.++++@++++Oh, what have I done?
Get in.++++@++++Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?
Get out of the car, Homer.++++@++++You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!
Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!++++@++++"The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!!" But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused.
We had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point.++++@++++Damn straight.
And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it.++++@++++You what?
So to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. Do you like it?++++@++++You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you...
I don't know, but it's starting to get dark.++++@++++What was that?
How ya doin'?++++@++++Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...
Welcome to Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, where you'll experience the complete rock 'n' roll lifestyle, without the lawsuits and STD's.++++@++++Woo! STD's!
Now you're all here for one reason...++++@++++To rock!
Have you been awake all night?++++@++++I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!
You took pills you found on the floor?++++@++++Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, "I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there.
Come on, who'd like to be a bass player?++++@++++Out of my way, Nerdlinger.
My image!++++@++++Here you go.
I'm telling Mr. Jagger.++++@++++Ooh, I'm telling Mr. Jagger.
The clothes you wear on stage should be a defiant statement of individuality.++++@++++Like this, Mr. Kravitz?
Fire! / Yes! / All right! Fire! / Hey!++++@++++Mr. Seltzer?
Setzer.++++@++++No, I think it's Seltzer.
What is it, Homer?++++@++++I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.
We've gotta start using a cheaper oatmeal.++++@++++Sorry Mick!
Look everyone, Homer's got it.++++@++++I'M SO HOT FOR ME, I'M SO HOT FOR ME / I'M SO COLD...
Lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting. But when you come up with something meaningful and heartfelt...++++@++++Bor-ing.
Will you stop saying that?++++@++++But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
You just want mindless generic rock?++++@++++Precisely.
Paparazzi to the left!++++@++++I got 'em!
They're bloody cardboard!++++@++++We know!
Uh, you rock, Homer.++++@++++Really? You really think I'm better than you?
That was great, Homie.++++@++++What the hell are you doing here?
Camp is over, Homer.++++@++++It's been a week already?
Let's rock 'n' roll...++++@++++Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two...
Come... on... Dad...++++@++++No! No, I won't go! You can't make me!
Dad, you knew this day was coming.++++@++++I knew nothing!
Stop kicking me, Dad!++++@++++Never!
No, I'm fine.++++@++++I'm so despondent.
Cheer up, Homer. It's only rock 'n' roll camp.++++@++++But I like it...
Tell you what. We're doing a benefit gig before we leave town. How would you like to join us on stage?++++@++++For serious?
For serious, Homer.++++@++++Can I have forty guest passes?
Sir, you can't...++++@++++All-access.
Wow Homer, I ain't had front row seats since my Moonie wedding.++++@++++And after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop.
I'm so proud of you, Homie. It's like you're Kid Rock and I'm Pamela Anderson Lee Rock.++++@++++Oops, gotta run. Enjoy the show.
Lenny, don't you have a crotch to stuff?++++@++++Evening, fellow rockers.
There you are. We thought we were going to have to go on without you.++++@++++I'm ready. Just give me a guitar. How many solos should I do? Four?
Uh, Homer, you didn't think you were gonna be playing with--++++@++++My official tour jacket!
Look, sorry if there's been a misunderstanding, Homer. We really just need you to tap the mics and say "test, test."++++@++++Can't you do it?
I'm his groupie! Am I saying that right, "groupie?"++++@++++Test, test...
Why is he performing the duties of a roadie? Am I saying that right, "roadie?"++++@++++Test, test. Check, check.
Hey, he's not rocking out at all.++++@++++Test... "TEST TEST, YOU'RE TESTIN' MY LOVE FOR YOU, CHECK CHECK, YOU'RE CHECKIN' TO SEE IF I'M TRUE..."
Not on my shift.++++@++++BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY... Uh-oh.
Did you know it was going to turn into a riot, Dad?++++@++++Oh, yeah... When you've been in as many as I have, you can sense them coming.
Did they ever find Tom Petty's toe?++++@++++What am I, the lost and found?
No, sorry.++++@++++There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail.
We're doing a gig tomorrow to benefit the victims of tonight's gig, and we'd consider it an honor if you'd join us.++++@++++Well, you're very sweet, Mick, but the only rocking I want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family.
Are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, Dad?++++@++++Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by.
Mr. Simpson, this zone is for school buses only.++++@++++Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!
A year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.++++@++++I've grown, you haven't.
Networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.++++@++++Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses.
Get back, honky cat! Those systems are too expensive.++++@++++Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children.
And the winner by a nose is "No Risk"!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Okay, now all we have to do is install your satellite dish. Can you be home from eight AM Monday morning, through June?++++@++++No problem.
Boy, that's Jim Dandy roof candy! I'd love to come over some time and watch that Church Channel.++++@++++I bet you would.
Oh, you'd win that bet. Seems like I'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. Or as I like to call it, "pray-per-view."++++@++++Damn your sparkling wordplay!
Cool! It's the NBC news feed!++++@++++Mmm... feed...
It's Wednesday night!++++@++++Kids, kids, you're both right.
Why don't you turn off the TV and join us for dessert? I made a pie.++++@++++Put pie here.
Would you like some ice cream with that?++++@++++Me not pig.
Sucker.++++@++++Homicidal robots... so like us.
To Fraternal Love.++++@++++The status quo.
I'm so sorry. Lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her.++++@++++Well, what about Bart?
The plastic casing from the tip of Bart's shoelace! A mother knows!++++@++++Well, he's not gonna get very far without that.
Oh my special little guys. You're okay, you're okay!++++@++++And Maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa.
The headlines proclaim "Dewey Defeats Truman."++++@++++Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?
Harry Truman triumphs by two million votes.++++@++++Not if I can stop that inauguration!
I win, Dad. That means I get to choose today's father-daughter activity!++++@++++Let's hear it.
We're building homes for the homeless.++++@++++You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself.
Dad, what is that?++++@++++Well, if Bart can be "El Barto"...
Oh. If only I had your courage, SeÃ±or.++++@++++Oh, thanks...
Dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring.++++@++++Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?
This is a Band-Aid wrapped in tin foil.++++@++++My real ring's inside a turtle.
Well, he's not much to look at...but he is a good father...Hel-lo, ring tan line! He's new on the market!++++@++++Can I help you?
Well, I've read enough articles about flirting to know it when I see it.++++@++++... And that's how my beautiful wife brought our son Bart into the world.
Ah, Homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?++++@++++Sure, why not?
Sometimes I worry you might think about other women.++++@++++Hey, why would I want Purina when I've got Fancy Feast right here?
That doesn't sound very convincing.++++@++++Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well...
Not feeling well. Going to bed. Dinner and breakfast are on the table.++++@++++Did you label the meals so I can tell which is which?
Homer, let me explain something--++++@++++Explain later!
Homie! Oooo, Homie... Hey, what happened?++++@++++I fell off. Hee hee hee.
Now, don't get too used to these. That awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days.++++@++++Yeah, he truly is a monster. Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. Just you, me, the kids and the twins. Whadaya say?
Whatever Bart is saying is a lie. Mom! What happened? Your endowment's bigger than Harvard's.++++@++++Well, that cinches it. Lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response.
Mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?++++@++++That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song.
HOORAY!++++@++++AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...
Homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?++++@++++Uh... I was gettin' around to it.
Kiki Highsmith, Highsmith Modeling. Honey, I like your look.++++@++++Forget it Kiki. You're not putting your brain into her body.
That's not why I'm here. I can offer your wife a lot of modeling work. Trade shows to start, then who knows?++++@++++No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.
I GOT KRUSTY IN HOT WATER / NOW I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM OUT / DA DA DA...++++@++++Shut up, boy.
Oh, I don't get a song? Mom got a song.++++@++++With the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup.
Hey, that's it. Mogumbo!++++@++++Do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?
Lisa learned a lesson! Lisa learned a lesson!++++@++++Kids, I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge.
I finally feel like me again. You're not disappointed, are you?++++@++++Not at all, sweetie. At least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one.
Anyway, you're the only man I want ogling me.++++@++++Oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling.
WHO LET HER JUGS OUT...?++++@++++D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
MARGE LET HER JUGS OUT...++++@++++D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
Yes, if he's smart, he'll hold out for millions.++++@++++Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...
Mm... that takes me back.++++@++++Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey.
Heads up, Dad. Here comes the scum!++++@++++Why can't they just be happy for my success?
This is a joke. You'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood.++++@++++Fine, watch your stupid Eagles concert.
It's a hockey game!++++@++++Whatever.
This sucks. How come Lisa gets something and I don't?++++@++++Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
Your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.++++@++++Hm. Better add some more nails.
Bart! Watch your potty mouth!++++@++++Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh.
Why do you always hire the cheapest guy?++++@++++I go by how funny the sign is.
But where will we live?++++@++++Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.
Sorry, folks. Every hotel room in town is booked.++++@++++Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.
I do not want another lecture from a German backpacker about how we don't appreciate the national park system.++++@++++I know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, Lenny.
Hey, Simpsons.++++@++++That's Lenny? Oh, I wanted the black one.
Wow, Lenny. Your apartment is stunning.++++@++++So how do you afford such a sweet pad?
Come on, guys, you gotta stay. Tonight's the big cock fight. Ah-- We can eat the loser...++++@++++Who wants to eat a loser?
Oh yeah, the gimmick is, it's a house from 1895. And you gotta do everything like they did back then.++++@++++1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy.
You could save McKinley.++++@++++It's not a time machine, Moe.
I like what I'm seeing in there.++++@++++I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!
They go to pieces over nothing. They're perfect for reality TV.++++@++++Where's that kid with my latte?!
Oh man, I can't wear this. I look like Buster Brown, whoever that is.++++@++++Oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, Lisa.
Hey, you should see how much trouble Dad's having shaving with a straight razor.++++@++++Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation.
Well, okay. Blow out that lamp and I'll take off my Victorian undergarments.++++@++++All right, let's take that...
If you just...++++@++++This comes off.
They're gay, I get it.++++@++++You've been in there over an hour, boy! Other people have to confess too, you know. Oh, I can't hold it in. I hate this house!
Yeah, I can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first.++++@++++Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!
With all this hard work, I'm too tired to worry about the world. And soon I will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!++++@++++Oh, I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife.
I guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.++++@++++Marge! Throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
Mr. Simpson, your contract allows us to do anything we want to you.++++@++++I would never sign that! Unless there was a red sticker that said "sign here."
Uh-huh, that's what we used.++++@++++Where do you get those things anyway?
Oh no, everything's ruined. Our good bellows... our stereopticon... Squiggy! Homer, your strop! Your strop!++++@++++Our lives are ruined!
We're not allowed to interfere with the reality of the show, which reminds me... Burn the leftovers! Leave nothing!++++@++++I can't remember the last time I cried like this.
When you put your T-shirt on backwards?++++@++++Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs.
Psst! Psst!++++@++++Savages! I'll handle this, Marge.
But now we're going to escape. We're going to overpower your crew and return to civilization.++++@++++Wow. Marge, I think I figured out their primitive language!
And yet I've learned nothing.++++@++++And now to wreck their precious helicopter.
No, Homer, no! That's our only way home!++++@++++Yeah, but... okay... Oh...
Oh, it sure is good to be home.++++@++++No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.
I think I'm gonna be sick.++++@++++That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.
Yeah. If we read books we could form a club.++++@++++If we formed a club we could serve drinks.
Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?++++@++++Good idea, Lisa.
No one will ever know.++++@++++Mail call!
Anything good?++++@++++The "George Foreman Mail Sorter" will let us know.
Help, please! Someone throw me a stick!++++@++++Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.
Ha, ha, ha. Go ahead, look. The whole world already saw it in "Nudist Camp Commandant." I wore nothing!++++@++++Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
Who ordered the steamed Gentile?++++@++++Mmm, steamed Gentile.
Don't worry, us pigs will catch this killer. Now Mr. Simpson, is it possible you're living a double or triple life that your wife doesn't know about?++++@++++Triple, no. Definitely no.
Now I will need round-the-clock access to all the Simpsons, especially Bart.++++@++++Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!
Dad, I can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own.++++@++++You'll understand someday when you have kids.
Fair enough. But now that we know what it can do, there's no need to... Mother F...!++++@++++Wow, you don't even have to point it at him.
Homer, think carefully. Of all the people you have known, who might have reason to do you ill?++++@++++Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush.
The late Frank Grimes...++++@++++PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick...
How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?++++@++++I'm a people person. Who drinks.
Homer, in order to identify your assailant, I must follow you through the course of a normal day. Just do what you usually do and the killer will reveal himself.++++@++++Gotcha.
This is a normal day?++++@++++I just wanted to impress you.
Welcome to your Springfield Mardi Gras headquarters. Cast your vote now for this year's king!++++@++++Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?
Our time is passing, old friend.++++@++++Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo.
Well, we've settled that argument. You can't read a magazine and drive.++++@++++Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts.
But your car was built in Croatia. It's made from old Soviet tanks.++++@++++Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench.
Homer please, the last thing you need is more enemies.++++@++++Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!
The trap is set. The killer will think this dummy is you, out for an evening stroll. Now we lie in wait, like hungry Cassius for noble Caesar.++++@++++You're so smart. Shock him.
Now who's the sociopath? Huh?++++@++++Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.
Thank you, Lord.++++@++++Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!
I'd just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.++++@++++Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.
Listen Homer, I don't know who your killer is, but I do know he'll strike again. Your only hope is to stay completely out of sight.++++@++++Very well. I am gone!
You've been elected King of Mardi Gras!++++@++++Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!
Honey, the king of Mardi Gras has to ride around on a float all day. You'll be a sitting duck.++++@++++Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen.
Homer, it's a trap. You only won because somebody stuffed the ballot box with these.++++@++++Nonetheless, the people have spoken.
But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.++++@++++Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday.
Today's Tuesday and you've had six beers.++++@++++But I'm not drunk!
The killer is out there. I would stake my entire fortune of cigarettes on it.++++@++++Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd.
Homer, you must get off that float! The brake line has been cut!++++@++++Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
Hey, how 'bout some beads?++++@++++They're not for dudes!
I've saved a life... and it feels wonderful. And yet, I could just as easily drop you to your death.++++@++++Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
Everything going dark... like Duff Stout, the beer that made Ireland famous. I love you, Doris! I...++++@++++We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?
There's your killer!++++@++++Well, duh.
Jesus is our only King.++++@++++Not anymore!
Frank Grimes, Junior.++++@++++Frank Grimes...
Don't you remember? Your ape-like incompetence drove my father insane.++++@++++Frank Grimes...
What's this? "Extremely High Voltage". Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp--++++@++++Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?
He's dead, like you should be!++++@++++Whoa, wait. Frank Grimes wasn't married. How could he have a son?
Dad! I figured it out! The murderer is...++++@++++We know. Frank Grimes, Jr.
Dad, I'm really glad you're still alive.++++@++++Yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. Goodnight, son.
THE VERY REASON THAT I LIVE / IS PLOTTING HOW TO WATCH HIM DIE...++++@++++Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
But I'm not tired!++++@++++Goodnight, sleepyhead. Do you have to poop?
Hey, I only hung out with Krabappel because Skinner blew her off. I've never seen her so sad.++++@++++You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.
And you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.++++@++++Which I did.
Sorry, Grampa.++++@++++Gator Gulch?
Grampa, you're not even going.++++@++++Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible...
I get to tamp the powder!++++@++++I wouldn't have it any other way.
This woman carried me for nine and a half months. I was out for two weeks, then went back in.++++@++++Hey Skinner! Do you and Edna want to join Marge and me at "Great Moments With Mr. Eisner"?
I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.++++@++++Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go.
So many categories... Gym teacher of the year, Substitute teacher of the year, Most Wheelchair-Accessible School Award?++++@++++Who will take home The Rampy?
I love teachers. In fact, I'm a teacher. I taught Paul McCartney to go "Whoo!"++++@++++Purple Rain!
Julio Estudiante...an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members that differential equations are more powerful than bullets.++++@++++What a rip! You all should be ashamed!
I love happy endings.++++@++++Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!
Step away from the wall. Step away from the wall.++++@++++Oh, it's so beautiful.
That'll be fourteen dollars.++++@++++Here!
Mom, Dad, my birthday's coming up, and GirlTech Turbo Diaries are in stores now.++++@++++Lisa, nobody likes a shill.
Just buy me the friggin' toy.++++@++++I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.
Dad, you can't eat all those free samples. We've got to get Lisa's present.++++@++++Watch and learn.
Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now you're eating men's slacks.++++@++++Eh, it's still better than Indian food.
Unauthorized user! Access denied!++++@++++Now what am I gonna get Lisa?
I wonder what mommy's medicine tastes like!++++@++++Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her?
Shop o' the mornin', Homer! Just call me "Mall" Flanders.++++@++++What are you buying? Jerk stuff?
Sounds like fun! Let's party!++++@++++Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!
I wonder what this could be?++++@++++I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Could it be some kind of book?++++@++++Well, yes and no.
You were supposed to get her that stupid diary!++++@++++But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.
I don't like McNuggets, I'm a vegetarian!++++@++++Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.
Dad! That information is all wrong! Maggie's a baby, not my best friend! You don't know anything about me!++++@++++Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!
I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.++++@++++I did it for the insurance money.
Dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. It's too late.++++@++++But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!
Yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart.++++@++++Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her.
He found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. Turns out I have severe schizophrenia.++++@++++Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?
No, look lower.++++@++++Ooh, pie.
What can I do for you?++++@++++My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.
Let me guess. It's about a girl.++++@++++How did you know?
It's always a dame. Usually with gams that don't quit. Till they get to the shoes. And then they're only napping.++++@++++Priceless.
Okay, I'll get a line on your kid. I charge fifty bucks a day. Plus expenses.++++@++++Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL.
Chunky... lover... 53?++++@++++It's one word.
One word.++++@++++Chunkylover53.
At AOL.++++@++++Dot com.
Is that Miles Davis' "Birth of The Cool?"++++@++++You should know. It is your favorite album.
So you know one thing about me. Big deal.++++@++++Wait, wait!
Well, maybe.++++@++++On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
And look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!++++@++++So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious.
Dad, today was so great. The animal rights protest, a visit to the Museum of Sadness and Oppression...++++@++++Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father.
How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?++++@++++Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?
What report?++++@++++Uh, report is a daddy word that means "loves his daughter."
You read the "loves his daughter" by yourself?++++@++++That's right, honey.
I believe there's still the matter of my expenses.++++@++++Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?
It's itemized.++++@++++A forty dollar steak?!
Yeah, but if I'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free.++++@++++You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?
Early on I was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. It didn't pan out.++++@++++I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
You'll regret the day you crossed Dexter Colt.++++@++++You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad?++++@++++Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...
Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad. I look just like a Powerpuff Girl.++++@++++I look just like Elvis!
Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather.++++@++++Uh, Rock Strongo.
Your real name?++++@++++Uh, Lance Uppercut.
Thank you. Sign here, Mr. Uppercut.++++@++++Let me just put on my glasses.
Uh, "A." And I'd like to add that proposition "Hug Lisa For Me" has my full support.++++@++++Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson.
Aw... Life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, Dad. I feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been.++++@++++Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world.
What? Why?++++@++++The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!
Why did you do that?++++@++++To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.
How could you?++++@++++Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea.
All right Simpsons, the jig is up! We know you're in there!++++@++++Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!
I don't wanna eat from the trash.++++@++++Oh, a banana!
Those are the test animals! The detective must have sold them to the circus.++++@++++We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.
How ya doin'.++++@++++Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.
You should have paid the expenses.++++@++++In retrospect, yes.
How did she find us?++++@++++Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!
I can't see!++++@++++How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
Hey Dad, will you read me a bedtime story?++++@++++Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there...
This was done on her wedding day. Or should I say "deading day."++++@++++How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!
Sword baseball bat, sword rifle, sword pineapple, sword sword sharpener, sword pie-- Hey what happened to the sword pie?++++@++++What do I do now?
Do you need some assistance picking over the tattered remains of my life?++++@++++No, I'm good.
What's there is there.++++@++++Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
My first weight set.++++@++++The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
They know you are talking about them.++++@++++I'll take it.
There is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.++++@++++No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for.
Sure, I'll carry you in this giant Snuggli. I used it to carry Rob Schneider in the movie "My Baby Is An Ugly Man."++++@++++Your heartbeat is so soothing.
Why is it Ned Flanders?++++@++++Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin.
All right, just to the mailbox and back.++++@++++Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
Two, three, two...++++@++++Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?
Two...++++@++++It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!
Ten, ten, ten, ten...++++@++++Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive.
Twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...++++@++++Run!
Oh my goodness, it looks just like the Kwik-E-Mart!++++@++++Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu...
I'm a magazine rack.++++@++++Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women.
Aggh! Silly String!++++@++++Kids, I'll go find your mother.
What if she doesn't?++++@++++Then we'll have to smoke her out.
The air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.++++@++++Bart, eat your spinach.
And all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.++++@++++It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till "Wings." Then you could just sleep till Monday.
Dad, do you plan to get in shape?++++@++++No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much.
I'm stronger than I've ever been! I don't have to go back inside. I'm not afraid!++++@++++Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!
You've just been Marge-inalized!++++@++++Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft.
Hey, hot stuff. I've got a competition tomorrow. I could use a good-luck snuggle.++++@++++I'd rather talk about our feelings. I feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. Rebuttal?
Let's do it!++++@++++Listen, my bulky flower, I-I have an early day...
Huh? Why didn't Mom make our lunch?++++@++++Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
I'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.++++@++++Quiet, her muscular ears can hear us.
So then I pop my delts, clench and bam! Not a dry eye in the house.++++@++++Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity.
And that's why I didn't win!++++@++++Sorry, sir, sorry.
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel...++++@++++Denser?!
You know, I really do miss being a lady.++++@++++And I miss being your knight in flabby armor.
Dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a WNBA game.++++@++++Yeah, well, nachos are nachos.
Fine, I'll go back to being bored.++++@++++Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that.
The winning fan is in Section A,++++@++++Yes...
Row 12...++++@++++Yes...
... Seat 16!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Thanks for supporting the WNBA, sir.++++@++++I think my leg is broken.
I'm sorry sir, your car is still blocked in...++++@++++Well, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck.
That cuts the mustard with me.++++@++++It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
The steering wheel is a giant onion ring!++++@++++They thought of everything! How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice? By which I mean Flanders!
That's because you keep passing out on our lawn.++++@++++No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.
Well, whatever I've got I owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a little prayer now and then.++++@++++So that's all it takes, a little prayer.
And now "Ken Burns," a documentary by Ken Burns about the life of Ken Burns.++++@++++Ugh, where's the remote?
They so consumed my life, I never had time for a proper haircut.++++@++++Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel.
I've never actually been to a baseball game. The fresh air gives me hives.++++@++++Die, monster!
You're watching Monkey Olympics on Fox!++++@++++It worked! I got my wish! From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding.
She's throwing her diaper at the judges!++++@++++O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz.
Setting up a prayer station, eh, Homer?++++@++++You know, I used to think God only helped professional athletes and Grammy winners. But now I realize he helps shmoes like me, too, Carl.
Makes sense to me. Ooh, by the way, did you see the judging in the monkey figure skating? Whose banana you gotta peel to get a five point nine? Could not believe that.++++@++++Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!
Fudge!++++@++++Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.
Homer, God isn't some kind of holy concierge. You can't keep bugging Him for every little thing.++++@++++Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.
I'll just call a plumber.++++@++++Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise...
You know, most people pray silently.++++@++++Marge, he's way the Hell up there.
Your pipes have more roots than the list of all-time top-rated TV shows.++++@++++Well, we could live with a stopped-up drain.
Slip and fall? Can't go back to work? I'm Larry H. Lawyer, Junior. And I will fight for you! I also habla espaÃ±ol.++++@++++So that's your answer! I'll sue the church!
Homer, we can't sue the church. They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.++++@++++It wouldn't be the first time.
Homer, please don't sue the church. I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.++++@++++Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
We're very sorry for the victim's injury. But as this tape demonstrates, Mr. Simpson is accident prone.++++@++++I can't see anything in this fog.
Okey-doke. We find for Mr. Simpson in the sum of one million dollars.++++@++++Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?
Dad, I think this might be the work of Satan.++++@++++It's all good.
That is gonna drive me nuts.++++@++++Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?
And there are so many places to cloister myself!++++@++++The dog's on board, too.
Well, the court has spoken, so... here you go. The baptismal font tends to run, you have to jiggle the handle. Oh, and Wednesday is garbage day.++++@++++Sweet.
Dad, there's a bunch of people in the Community Outreach Center.++++@++++We'll just see about that.
Homer, that was not very Christian of you.++++@++++You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!
So where's Marge?++++@++++She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.
Homer aren't you afraid you might be, I don't know, incurring God's wrath?++++@++++Eh, God's cool.
See, I don't know that He is. In the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt.++++@++++Oh look, God's giving us a little shower.
Dear Lord, please spare this sinful town. They were misled by a demon in blue pants.++++@++++I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.
I can't believe you talked me into this.++++@++++It's such a mess. Watch the teeth!
How could you make me Baby Stink Breath and not even tell me?++++@++++I was going to tell you on my deathbed.
Your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a...++++@++++La la la la la la la la la.
But there must be some sort...++++@++++La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.
You spent all the money I earned?!++++@++++I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.
Bart, stop that!++++@++++That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.
Mom, I am sick of the way he treats me. He disrespects me and I'm just supposed to accept it?++++@++++That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog.
I heard a wonderful saying today: "forgive and forget."++++@++++Yes, son. At times like this I just look at my bracelet.
Good point, Dad. What would Jesus do?++++@++++Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!
I'm here to serve you with a subpoena.++++@++++Well, I'm not opening the door.
It comes with a side of bacon.++++@++++Is it crispy?
Yes, I want to be emancipated.++++@++++Emancipated? Don't you like being a dude?
Mom, you've always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and I'm not gonna take it anymore.++++@++++Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find.
Mr. Simpson. Your son alleges that you have an anger management problem...++++@++++Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor.
All rise for the verdict.++++@++++Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can.
No judge would send a pre-teen out on his own...++++@++++Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.
Further, I hereby garnish Homer's wages until Bart is fully repaid.++++@++++Mmmmm... garnish.
That means half your paycheck goes to Bart!++++@++++What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
Homer, don't make things worse.++++@++++I'll show you worse!
Sorry Mom. I gotta go.++++@++++Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back.
Darn it! I keep pouring juice for five.++++@++++Did you see that, boy? Your mom thinks you're still here!
I think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.++++@++++For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father.
Hi guys... Dad.++++@++++Hello, son. You're looking well.
Well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive TV.++++@++++Of course, because you wouldn't want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!
Well, that's great, honey.++++@++++Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
Thanks Dad, that means a lot to me.++++@++++So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?
Just a reminder: If you're getting bogus returns on your investments...contact Goldman Sachs, the skewwwed financial planners. Up next on the half-pipe, boarding legend Tony Hawk.++++@++++Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?
An extreme word?++++@++++Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...
I didn't say extreme to the max.++++@++++Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.
I can relate. I'm a father myself. One day they're little shredders. And the next day they're grinding and gnashing their way to college.++++@++++Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again.
This board represents the ultimate in poser technology. It gives people the illusion they have talent.++++@++++Groovy.
Just lock your feet in and the board does all the work.++++@++++All the work?
Now the portion of our event where champion Tony Hawk may be challenged by any unknown member of the audience.++++@++++I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it.
Dad, how drunk are you?++++@++++Not very!
Dad, you don't understand. This was never about being cool. It was about you not caring how I felt.++++@++++Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid.
Mr. Simpson, I like the way you handled yourself on that board. Would you like to do a commercial for us?++++@++++Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.
Excellent. I represent Viagrogaine, the topical rub for bald, impotent men.++++@++++Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?
Oh, Steve. You're everything a girl could want. What's your secret?++++@++++Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?
Ooh, a new hamburger sandwich.++++@++++Wow, I can't wait to pack that into my colon.
Dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. You're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart.++++@++++I got arm veins, don't I?
It was so exciting -- I actually got applause for being smart!++++@++++Mars, eh? Hmmm, I see no evidence of water.
Hey, hey the Ribwich is back!++++@++++The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!
Try the new Ribwich. It's so good you'll croak!++++@++++You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
Try the sauce -- I'm soaked in it!++++@++++I could lick you all day long.
And yet my children think I'm a failure.++++@++++One Ribwich please.
Sir, are you all right?++++@++++I have eaten the ribs of God.
Oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!++++@++++Hey, who doesn't?
Well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?++++@++++That sounds like a magical family moment. I'm sorry I won't be there.
Really? It won't be the same without you, Dad.++++@++++Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side.
He's an acerose.++++@++++Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!
Dude. If you still want the Ribwich, they're testing it in other markets. Check out the tour schedule.++++@++++Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town.
That's what we do. We're Ribheads.++++@++++Maybe I should hook up with you guys. After all, how long do any of us have to live?
Welcome to the games of the 34th Spellympiad. I'm George Plimpton, founder of the Paris Review. I also played the evil dean in "Boner Academy."++++@++++You monster! Why did you expel Boogerman?
He replaced my tennis racket with a rubber phallus.++++@++++That was awesome!
Well, I'm just happy you guys all came up here to Calgary with me.++++@++++I'm sorry, honey. I can't be here tomorrow. It's the last day the Ribwich is in San Francisco.
Dad, this is my moment in the sun. How can you miss it to be with a sandwich?++++@++++You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!
Lisa, may I see you privately for a moment?++++@++++This can only be good.
Hey man, can you turn me on?++++@++++Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.
Will you get out of my... Look, about the Ribwich. There aren't gonna be anymore -- the animal we made 'em from is now extinct.++++@++++The pig?
People, we went through something magical together -- and it's not important who got rich off of whom, or who was exposed to tainted what. And because you believed in my dream, I want you to fight over the last Ribwich ever made. Here.++++@++++Welcome to the real world, hippies!
I give-a you the lease-a to my car.++++@++++Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car.
Intransigence. "I..."++++@++++Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!
Dad, you do care!++++@++++Damn right honey. You're number one on my menu. Now super-size it!
Lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing.++++@++++Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car.
Hold your horses. I was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.++++@++++It came out again.
Oh, what a magical evening. The moonlight, the music, the water...++++@++++Enough talk. Dip me, my love.
Poor Ned. This is his first Jellyfish Festival alone.++++@++++I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers.
Psst! Homer!++++@++++Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning?
I need your advice. It's about a lady.++++@++++Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it.
No, it's Sara Sloane. I have a date with her tonight.++++@++++Sara Sloane? The movie star?
Yep. Why would that Twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?++++@++++Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie.
Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett.++++@++++Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.
Now she's dating Mr. Flanders. That's so romantic!++++@++++Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders.
Mm-hmm. I haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.++++@++++Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M.
Why, those guys are such leeches.++++@++++Moe, what are you doing here?
Homer, Sara wants us to have S-E-X.++++@++++Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.
Well, I'm not sure I want to do it. I mean "who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?" You know, the cow being me.++++@++++Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better.
I bet we woulda lasted twice that long.++++@++++Poor Ned, gardening away his misery.
I'm very happy for you, Ned.++++@++++Me too.
I need a quarter for the bus.++++@++++Droll.
I got Lisa's plankton kebabs!++++@++++Marge germs!
How much longer is this going to go on?++++@++++I'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.
Dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?++++@++++I'm on my way. You man the rake.
We've already been to room 915. We've already filled out form 1790.++++@++++It was an application to open a Cinnabon stand.
I never thought I would say this, but I think we have to move.++++@++++Never!
Occasionally, you might hear a faint roar...++++@++++See, it all works out?
It's a good offer. I advise you to take it.++++@++++Make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.
Why don't we go to our Congressman?++++@++++That's a great idea. Why didn't you say something before?
I've been saying it for three weeks! But every time I open my mouth...++++@++++What?
Quick! Someone perform CPR.++++@++++I SEE A BAD MOON RISING...
That's CCR!++++@++++LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN FOR NASTY WEATHER...
Congressman Wilcox was laid to rest today. A special election will be held next month to fill his vacant seat.++++@++++I guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
How can you say that?++++@++++It's just an expression, Marge.
Why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?++++@++++Eh, I'm still undecided.
Because I was thinking about the American family! One family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn.++++@++++Bo-ring!
I'm talking about the Simpsons.++++@++++Let him speak!
You said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. And now they're worse than ever.++++@++++Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document.
Dad, this is a kid's menu where you help Yogi Bear get to the Washington Monument.++++@++++Stained with the blood of American patriots.
That's jelly.++++@++++From the unknown toaster.
We've gotta do something to help him.++++@++++Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
Excuse me, I think I can help. I've been working in this town for a long time, and well, I know how to get things done.++++@++++Beat it, Waxie.
Now Homer, that Southern Congressman is your biggest obstacle. Your job is to drink him under the table so he misses the vote. You think you can do it?++++@++++Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!
How 'bout a drinkin' contest, boy? Right after I vote on the latest bill.++++@++++How 'bout before?
Now we just need a distraction.++++@++++You call this a bicameral legislature?
At last those planes are flying where they belong.++++@++++That's right. Over the homes of poor people.
What about you and Mom?++++@++++Oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire.
Oh, okay.++++@++++Children, so naÃ¯ve.
Who's naÃ¯ve?++++@++++I didn't say anything. So naÃ¯ve.
This is so romantic.++++@++++Oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. Have some more liquor.
Homie, I'm sorry... you know I usually bring my A-game to the bedroom... but tonight I just can't throw the heat.++++@++++But it's St. Valentine's Day! God wants us to do it.
You're so cute when you're begging for sex, but I'm just too tired.++++@++++Well, my special mix tape will get you going.
Game over.++++@++++Everyone but me.
Welcome to "How to Strip for Your Wife".++++@++++Dr. Hibbert? You're the teacher?
Homer, are you already oiled?++++@++++Three coats.
Homer, take this quarter, call your mother and tell her you're never going to be a stripper.++++@++++Aren't you gonna chuckle?
You there, the greasy, naked bald man!++++@++++You know everything about me!
What would you say if I offered you the secret of true success?++++@++++Wipe me down and sign me up!
The trick is to blot the oil. Wiping just pushes it around.++++@++++You're preaching to the choir, man.
You see this watch? It's jammed with so many jewels, the hands can't move. What kind of watch do you have?++++@++++Uh, well, I drew it on... See...
Friends, there's a force that runs through the universe. We used to call that force "God." We now call it "Megatronics: The Forty-eight Tips To Corporate Success."++++@++++Oooh, published by Kinko's!
Do you want to be the ultimate you?++++@++++Yes!
Do you want to yodel at the top of the corporate mountain?++++@++++Yes!
Will you write me a check made out to "cash?"++++@++++God yes!
Sounds good to me.++++@++++Go on ahead. I'll just slow you down.
What's that ruckus?++++@++++It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are.
Uh-oh, that's toxic waste!++++@++++And now to see Mr. Burns for the promotion and raise I've deserved since this morning.
Oh, have you now? Well huzzah, huzzah. I'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight.++++@++++But the book said you would applaud my initiative.
Would you mind?++++@++++Yes, sir.
I didn't know Mr. Burns had an electric eel pond.++++@++++Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a "way to be" or a "you go, girl." No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small.
Oh, Homie. Don't let it get you down. So Mr. Burns doesn't take you seriously? Big whoop! Who gives a doodle? Whoopie ding dong doo!++++@++++Thanks for trying, but I'll be at Moe's.
Who's this Burns guy? Somebody you work with?++++@++++Moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years.
Well, if this guy's ridin' your rump, why don't you slap him some payback?++++@++++Revenge? On Mr. Burns?
Or give him some face time with sweet lady brick.++++@++++No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral.
Don't you get it? If you get rid of that bird, Burns is at your mercy.++++@++++Get rid of a bird? No way. Their eyes are so expressive.
Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?++++@++++Mr. Burns! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is here for a surprise inspection!
Good Lord! That canary was supposed to be my pigeon. I need to find a patsy quick!++++@++++Hello!
Yes, yes, hello. Now, I need to find a patsy.++++@++++Hello!
You're quite the friendly fellow, but right now I'm looking for a patsy.++++@++++Hello!
You bumbling fool, I keep telling you I'm looking for a patsy.++++@++++Hello!
Finally, I would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now Mr. Homer J. Simpson.++++@++++That's right. And as my first act... Mr. Burns, you're fired!
That man's mad. Smithers, get this bedlamite an alienist!++++@++++No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!
So, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. I only have one thing to say to that... bravo.++++@++++Huh?
We clashed lances on the Champs de Mars, and I have been bested. The plant is yours. Treat her well.++++@++++Mr. Burns?
HEY-EY-EY, GOODBYE!++++@++++Hey, that looks fun! Do me!
Oh, I don't think he was going that way.++++@++++Unlike Mr. Burns, I will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. And now, as I ascend this crystal staircase to my office, I say: avert your gaze!
Dad, please. You're the head of a major corporation.++++@++++You're right. Put two walnuts in there.
Dad, have you looked at this earnings report?++++@++++Sweetie, these things are gonna take time. I just found the door-shutting thing.
If you don't patch the leak in cooling tower two, you will go to jail.++++@++++I need a vacation.
This is your vacation.++++@++++Can't I water ski a little bit?
Homer I'll go over the year-end profit forecast if you'll stop looking at my boobs.++++@++++No deal!
I got a gold star at school today, for my exposÃ© on toxins in gold-star adhesive.++++@++++That's great, honey. Hold it up to the camera.
Homie, I know you've got a lot of work to do. But this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family.++++@++++Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f...
Dad, this just isn't working.++++@++++Lisa, I deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce.
Hey Dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight.++++@++++Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss.
I don't wanna do that.++++@++++C'mon, boy. You're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor.
Homie?++++@++++Hey, honey. Sorry I'm so late. I had to lay off twenty-seven robots. Don't tell me they can't cry.
Knock, knock.++++@++++Mr. Burns! Where's Mr. Smithers?
He's doing eighty years on an opium bust. I never saw a man take to a Turkish prison so quickly.++++@++++How did you ever run this place? You've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon...
Does it bother you that Krusty uses mad-cow beef to save money?++++@++++Yes, yes. If I keep putting work first, I'll lose everyone I care about, just like you did.
Scream all you like, no one will hear you!++++@++++I don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. I don't even want it.
Brick by brick, I seal his doom.++++@++++There you go.
Hey Dad, pitch to me!++++@++++From now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest Dad.
Hey! You nearly hit me on the head!++++@++++Quit crowding the plate!
Y'see? This is the stuff Mom won't do with me.++++@++++Yeah.
And what's that?++++@++++No, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer.
Nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. All that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.++++@++++Talking won't get you there.
Dad, my life lacks direction!++++@++++It's a concern. A serious concern.
Oh Dad, look at this one!++++@++++Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check.
We certainly do.++++@++++Boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
Why did you say that? Is your check gonna bounce?++++@++++No, of course not!
Why did you say that? Are you implying that I'm dumb?++++@++++I have to go.
Dad, that's a moth.++++@++++Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?
Dad, that's a kaleidoscope.++++@++++You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings.
Uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.++++@++++Mmm... bad eggs.
Okay, we've gotta start recruiting, Lou.++++@++++Hey Mr. Smithers!
Pro or con?++++@++++I'unno. What am I, Superdad?
Boy, this light has really screwed up the animals.++++@++++I'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.
Live from New York it's Saturday Night!++++@++++Don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?
Palm recognized. Access granted!++++@++++Aw... my baby's first words.
It worked -- I got my sky back! Dad, look!++++@++++Night... glorious night...
I wonder what Mom came up with for this week's 'Family Wednesday.'++++@++++I hope it's as fun as Pictionary was last week.
Dad, we weren't playing Pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking.++++@++++What? Are you sure?
I'm in.++++@++++Oh, I hate this. It's making me use my arms.
Does anyone have any swan heads? I've got nothing but necks.++++@++++Can't help you -- all I got is gray. Anybody working on a cement wall?
Turn it over, Homer.++++@++++Oh, right. Chinese guy, Chinese guy, frisbee dog...
Homer, no scissors!++++@++++It's how the pros do it.
Oh, I guess he's done with all the fun stuff.++++@++++Now let's see. This is either an old coconut... or Tom Hayden.
I can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.++++@++++It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.
Ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. But it looks like you're missin' a piece.++++@++++Looks like you're missing a wife.
This awful. It's like listening to Schubert's unfinished symphony!++++@++++Or when I messed up taping "City Slickers 2" and cut off the end. Was Curly's gold just a legend?
I shouldn't have cheaped out on the shelf.++++@++++I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
Young man, you've ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.++++@++++The only dangerous amount is none!
I found the missing puzzle piece. It was under Maggie's eyelid!++++@++++How 'bout that?
It's James Taylor!++++@++++Oh, the popular singer slash songwriter slash puzzle piece.
MOCK...++++@++++Yeah.
ING...++++@++++Yeah.
BIRD...++++@++++Whatever.
Oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?++++@++++No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this.
Oh my God, I forgot all about this. Where did you find it?++++@++++More like, where didn't I find it. It was practically everywhere.
Homer, I'm sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night.++++@++++Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?
Well, I love you, of course. But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.++++@++++So you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
A little bit, yeah.++++@++++Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.
Looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.++++@++++That was a muffin!
I'll fix you something.++++@++++Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too "drunk" to do it right.
Well, there are a lot of beer cans around here.++++@++++Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?
Homer, let it go. It's not always going to be perfect. We've been married for ten years.++++@++++Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?
Well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.++++@++++It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells.
Maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...++++@++++Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?
Dad, where are you going?++++@++++Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.
But you're not gonna get divorced like Milhouse's parents, are you?++++@++++No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father.
Welcome to my place. I just have a few rules. If you see a necktie on the doorknob, I'm with a lady.++++@++++You don't have a doorknob.
Uh, Homer, I think you want your house, next door.++++@++++Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box.
Hello, Simpson.++++@++++What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented.
No. He's nobody! Shut up, Stuart!++++@++++Nice to meet you, Stuart.
Homer, before you move in, you should know that Julio and I have an active social life.++++@++++Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly.
Homer, what Grady is saying is that, how can I put this? We might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male.++++@++++Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
That's right, Homer. We're gay.++++@++++You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it.
Uch, where'd you buy this? From the guy on the exit ramp? This is disgusting.++++@++++Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way.
Thank you, Homer. It's a pleasure cooking for you.++++@++++Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay.
It's either him or that girl who put "Mother Earth" as a reference. And with a male roommate, we can walk around naked.++++@++++Way ahead of you.
That will be one hundred dollars.++++@++++I see.
Your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.++++@++++Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have.
Hey, I love watching you guys fight. It's my earliest memory.++++@++++Why you little...!
Dad, your hands feel so soft.++++@++++You noticed! I've been using LancÃ´me.
Oh, it shows! I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was four.++++@++++Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you.
So, how was your visit home?++++@++++The kids are cool, but Marge is still judging me.
So, it's over between you two.++++@++++Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance.
He's gay. He's gay. Gay. Gay. Bi. Gay. Gay for pay. Gay.++++@++++Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?
Homie, I tried to tell you how I feel, but I can't find the right words. Maybe he can.++++@++++Weird Al Yankovic!
Homer, Marge wrote me about what happened. And as soon as her check cleared, I was on the first reasonably-priced flight here.++++@++++Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?
They were pretty much the same, Homer.++++@++++Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman.
Now here's a song I wrote for you. A LITTLE DITTY 'BOUT HOMER AND MARGE / HER HEART WAS AS BIG AS HIS STOMACH WAS LARGE / OH YEAH, THEY SAY LOVE GOES ON / LONG AFTER THE GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH IS GONE.++++@++++It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?++++@++++I don't know... date a chick with kids...
Well, we've got the cure for that. Margaritas!++++@++++Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!
Homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?++++@++++You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?
Hey, Julio: ouch.++++@++++I gotta go.
We welcome Cub Scout troop number 102, we wish a happy birthday to Karen, and congratulations to Marge and Homer Simpson on their reconciliation dinner.++++@++++Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.
That's better.++++@++++But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!
Oh Homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble. Believe me.++++@++++Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
But it's still not as bad as the first time I treated you for alcohol poisoning.++++@++++Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage.
Destroyed your marriage? Why, I've never seen a woman look so devoted. Let's look at the tape.++++@++++You have that on tape?!
He's stable now. I'll leave you two alone.++++@++++So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!
And I still do.++++@++++Marge, I never want to be apart from you again.
Well, you'll never have to.++++@++++That is the best kiss I've had tonight.
Homie, what are you thinking?++++@++++Manly thoughts.
Not true! But you are welcome to sing the many beloved public domain carols such as O Tannenbaum, Good King Wenceslas, Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring--++++@++++Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.
Hey Homer, writing a new Christmas carol?++++@++++Maybe.
Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus.++++@++++Flanders, I am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. But even I have my limits. Now beat it!
F-L-A-N-R-D-S!++++@++++HE'S THE MAN THAT I HATE BEST / I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS HOUSE GO UP IN FLAME!
Yeah, he wishes.++++@++++Hey, Mister? If you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? It's already rewound.
No thanks. But I would like to sing it with you and produce it.++++@++++Fine.
F-L-A!++++@++++His name is Ned!
E-R-S!++++@++++Ned's a stupid name! HE'S WORSE THAN FRANKENSTEIN OR DR. NO.
D-E-R!++++@++++His wife is dead!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FEET / JUST HATE FLANDERS TO THE DISCO BEAT...++++@++++HE'S YOUR PERKY, PEPPY NIGHTMARE NEIGHBORINO!
Mass dismissed!++++@++++Hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?
I am so sick of that song!++++@++++Me too -- I've come to hate my own creation. Now I know how God feels.
Why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?++++@++++Well, I guess we could afford one nice trip.
I still think you should have left that at the motel.++++@++++What? It said "take one."
And there's no radio or TV, so we won't have to hear your song!++++@++++Sweet.
Or we could go to Walter Gropius's Bauhaus Village?++++@++++And fight the crowds? Forget it. The Simpsons are going to Bart's idea!
"On this battleground in 1881, fifty-six Indians lost their lives and four brave Americans lost their hats."++++@++++Those poor hats.
Daddy, I need upsies!++++@++++Coming, sweetie!
Would you like to be photographed in my great-grandfather's headdress? He unified the nations of the western plains. Five dollars, or three for twelve.++++@++++Can you shoot one where I'm Rambo and my wife is Betty Boop?
Unfortunately, the beaver is also our God. In retrospect it was a poor choice.++++@++++You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?
Sure. And when we do, your breakfast will be comped.++++@++++How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
Eight.++++@++++Three.
Four.++++@++++Deal. My brother...
I'll save you!++++@++++So long, suckers!
Oh no! They're making beautiful music together!++++@++++/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
Homie, I'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up.++++@++++It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?
They took the bait. Let's go.++++@++++Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!
Actually, it's Fresca.++++@++++Fresca?!
Homer, those are elk.++++@++++I still hate them. Go back to Pittsburgh!
Lisa, welcome to love. It's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. But then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts.++++@++++Who is he?!
You, Homie.++++@++++Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!
Can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?++++@++++Only if it's an affront to God.
Hey, you passed the lumberyard.++++@++++Only losers buy wood. We're going to nature's lumberyard.
Isn't this dangerous?++++@++++It's okay, Bart. This track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh.
I'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track.++++@++++Did Frank Lloyd Wright have to deal with people like you?
Actually, Frank Lloyd Wright endured a lot of harsh criticism.++++@++++Look, I have no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright is.
You said his name two seconds ago.++++@++++I was just puttin' words together.
Gotcha.++++@++++Well, two can play at that game.
Oh, that's it. You are going down.++++@++++Stop it!
The Amish are so industrious. Not like those shiftless Mennonites.++++@++++Son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. It really restores your faith in helpful weirdos.
Very nice. Did you do the wiring yourself?++++@++++Heck no, the Amish did it. Who knows more about electricity than the Amish?
/ Help!++++@++++Watch your step... Don't panic... By going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue.
Homie, get out of that treehouse!++++@++++Move the net under the window.
Our little hero sure likes Kahlua and Cream.++++@++++Quit following me, you coward!
Mr. Simpson, how long have you been a cat person?++++@++++All my life, Kent. I prefer "catsup" to "ketchup." And to me, "Yusuf Islam" will always be "Cat Stevens."
Terrific stuff. You must really love the Broadway musical "Cats."++++@++++God no, it sucks.
Seems like you're quite the animal lover. Do you have any other pets? A dog perhaps?++++@++++Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog.
Stop it, Homer, that's inhumane! Use the choke chain!++++@++++Fine.
According to this contract, we have to change his name to "Suds McDuff."++++@++++I don't care if his name is Bony McDork, just make the checks out to me.
It also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the Duff corporate jet.++++@++++Corporate jet?
Oh pilot, let's swing by... oh, Heidelberg and drop in on Oktoberfest.++++@++++Sweet.
Dad, five minutes ago you hated him.++++@++++Who are you, my biographer?
...eight, nine, ten wads of cash. Your dog has sent Duff beer sales through the roof.++++@++++Boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of Marge.
Oh really? Well this tape says different.++++@++++Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog.
Dad, you can't let him take our dog!++++@++++My wads! I never even broke the wrapper.
But I miss him. He was my best friend.++++@++++Aww. There, there, boy. I'll help you get him back. He may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a Simpson that isn't.
Look, to get our dog back, we need a plan.++++@++++A plan, eh? Okay, we'll use a plan.
This stunt cost fifty million dollars!++++@++++Help! Help! I'm drowning!
And you've been bitching about it for thirty years.++++@++++Everything is going according to plan. I'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
Are you there, God? It's me, Duffman.++++@++++Now let me think. How did that beautiful young naked lady in "Jaws" make it out alive?
It's good to have you back with the Simpsons.++++@++++I'm sorry I was ever mean to you. Marge, prepare the celebration ham.
All we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.++++@++++Marge, they're just hams, okay.
Uh-oh, Dad. I think he peed on the rug.++++@++++To me that says "I love you."
I think he left a "big hug" in your lunch box.++++@++++Aw, it was probably that stupid cat.
That cat saved your life.++++@++++What has he done for me lately?
He woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.++++@++++Yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna.
Dad, you ate the last can of tuna.++++@++++Everyone's against me.
Okay, five more minutes and I'm chewing my hand off.++++@++++Bart, are you okay?
Homie, where have you been? I've been calling all over for you!++++@++++Hey, take it easy. I went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family...
He's Editor-In-Chimp!++++@++++That monkey's wearin' a hat.
Well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so I can reach you.++++@++++You can't just "get" a cell phone.
Lindsay Naegle -- Veriqual Cellular. And I can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions.++++@++++Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican Hat Dance?
I insist on it.++++@++++I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING...
Why don't you get one of those hands-free phones? It's the next best thing to paying attention to the road.++++@++++Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute.
Of course we have headsets. But you would be mad to stop there. Tell me -- what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter?++++@++++Uh... a lighter.
I weep for you. These days, everything from fax machines to coffee makers can be plugged into your "dash hole."++++@++++I'll take 'em.
I guess I'll have to do all your driving chores. That's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.++++@++++That reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville.
Why can't you use the local dry cleaner?++++@++++I didn't want them to know my size.
Dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. Why don't you take public transportation?++++@++++Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.
Way to go, Dad!++++@++++You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.
Get in here, boozy. You're late for your drunkening.++++@++++No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover.
Good for you, Dad. Could you get me some syrup?++++@++++You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup.
We don't have time for choking!++++@++++Calm down, Stresserella!
I'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, I'm a full-time family chauffeur!++++@++++Now now, honey. We all appreciate what you do. But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission.
To hell with the Livery Commission!++++@++++Marge, you don't know what you're saying!
Read the directions silently as I read them aloud to you.++++@++++Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want.
We're playing dominoes.++++@++++I said, "Bishop to queen four."
Why, you're the first one here! Please accept this free ticket to the 1939 World's Fair.++++@++++Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking.
Stop saying things!++++@++++Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us?
Hey, I'd like that. I can't. I have to go pick up Grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station.++++@++++You sure love driving.
Yeah, walking's made a new man out of you.++++@++++It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
YOU SHAKE ME FROM MY BOOTY TO MY 'FRO...++++@++++YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD...
Bite us.++++@++++I CAN WALK FROM SPRINGFIELD TO ALASKA / THEN HOBNOB WITH THE STARS IN MALIBU...
Hi Homer. I'm actor Steve Buscemi.++++@++++The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in "Fargo"?
YOU CAN'T WALK TO TURKMENISTAN!++++@++++I SAY "OF COURSE I CAN -- SCREW YOU!"
Would we!++++@++++OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO...
I am so sorry, Homie. How is your crushed pelvis?++++@++++Pretty good. Thanks for asking.
I don't know what happened. I saw you and I went for the brake but I hit the accelerator!++++@++++It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch.
That's okay. I can handle it. Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?++++@++++Too hot! Too hot!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!++++@++++Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!
Oh, you're really coming along, Homie.++++@++++Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever.
Oh my God! Let me help you up!++++@++++Marge, you're trying to hurt me!
What? That's crazy.++++@++++No, it's true. The car, the soup... It's like you hate me... your own husband...
That's ridiculous. I don't like you. I mean hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you!++++@++++I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you.
Maybe we should see a counselor.++++@++++Who's "we"? Got a mouse in your purse?
Perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner and more of a doormat.++++@++++Nothing could be farther from the...
All right, before you came in, I asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. Homer, you first.++++@++++There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me.
That's us in a nutshell. I care so much about you, Homer, but I'm not even on your list. Excuse me.++++@++++We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog?
All right. I have an answer. You must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.++++@++++You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
You gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says I care about you.++++@++++I see. Do you have any suggestions?
I do, but the hour is over.++++@++++Here's a dollar.
Romantic dinner.++++@++++Gotta go.
You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha, anyway, what's goin' on?++++@++++I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings.
Hey, me too. I could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons Ã  la Carl.++++@++++You can bring a bag of ice.
Oh Homie, you got everyone in Springfield here for me!++++@++++Honey, I couldn't keep 'em away if I tried. Except for Flanders. He was mysteriously called out of town.
Just kidding. Here's one of my many classics.++++@++++That I fixed with new words!
YOU HOOKED UP IN HIGH SCHOOL / NOW YOU'VE COME SO FAR / THEN YOU STARTED TO HATE HIM / AND HIT HIM WITH YOUR CAR.++++@++++SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.
I love you, too.++++@++++So you don't want to kill me anymore?
Except a place to live and free food.++++@++++Why you little...
I want to thank you all so much.++++@++++You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean.
Vite! Vite!++++@++++And now, to all my dear friends, I say... get the Hell out of my yard.
Is it hyphenated?++++@++++I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO
Ned, I am so sorry.++++@++++I never knew you were such a Beatles fan.
I am so tired of that tautology.++++@++++It's not all his fault. I blame this latchkey kid.
You are so right, Ned. There won't be a single minute where Bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... Homer, get over here!++++@++++Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!
Here are some supervised activities we can all do together. Future Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 5-H Club...++++@++++Five-H?
You won't be seeing Milhouse for a while. Something about that boy just shakes up your soda. Ooh, this looks interesting: The Pre-Teen Braves.++++@++++Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. "Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."
Dad, maybe you could lead Bart's tribe.++++@++++You mean like some sort of madman?
Ideally no, but...++++@++++I'll do it!
I am "Burger With Fries." Man, is that uninspired.++++@++++Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War.
Hey, Lazy Horse! Find us something cool to do.++++@++++The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever.
I smell smoke.++++@++++Without the talking stick, we don't hear you.
Well, thank you. I'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible Pre-Teen Brave experience.++++@++++But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal.
And now the land weeps.++++@++++Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?
"We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids."++++@++++Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty.
Get your un-poisoned candy!++++@++++It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
Oh, the indignity!++++@++++Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?
At least we made a lot of people sick.++++@++++Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
It's on the back of our vests.++++@++++Marge, remove that stitching.
VIP? That's us!++++@++++People will do anything a sign tells them.
Pound him, Milhouse!++++@++++You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower.++++@++++How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
Because I know every time you say "pick a number from one to ten," it's always seven.++++@++++That's because there were seven apostles.
No, there were twelve.++++@++++Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny.
The Venus Flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...++++@++++Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
Dad, the traffic's moving.++++@++++Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!
My baby!++++@++++Your baby!
Whaaa--?++++@++++Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...
Ain't she adorable.++++@++++Oh my God, I'm late for work.
Ball pit, that's nice. One, two, three colors -- you got 'em all.++++@++++It's Patty, chump!
Well, I have so much free time now that Moe's our babysitter.++++@++++Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!
You could be my father figure.++++@++++No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back.
I can help you.++++@++++I said, pipe down, Amtrak.
Yeah, sure he was, Nahasapasa-Imraisin'apervert.++++@++++Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me.
You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies?++++@++++... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.
I peed my pants.++++@++++I recorded that for private use!
I had to. It's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound.++++@++++That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore.
Eh? Eh?++++@++++Get your own family, Moe.
Hey, you never cared about Maggie 'til I started paying attention to her. Last night at the bar you called her "Raquel."++++@++++Get out!
Is that uh, "get out" like leave, or "get out" as in: "Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"++++@++++Get out!
Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender.++++@++++Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own.
Maggie's gone!++++@++++It must have been Moe!
Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall.++++@++++Uh, no, that was me.
Listen, I think we might have to make a trip to Little Italy.++++@++++I'll get our little passports.
Maggie's right in the middle of that Italian-American-Mexican standoff!++++@++++Oh my God, I've gotta save her!
No, no, don't try to stop me.++++@++++We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya.
Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper.++++@++++Or worse, am I right?
I don't think Maggie wants you out of her life, Moe.++++@++++Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham.
Will everyone please stop fighting and burning!++++@++++Never!
I am Death!++++@++++Death? We don't want any.
Your time is up, Bart Simpson.++++@++++This is for Snowball One and JFK!
Dad, do you realize what you've done? You've created a world without Death.++++@++++Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?
I guess so.++++@++++Nooooo!
Homer, it's trash day. Will you just take him out to the curb?++++@++++I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
Dad, you've become the new Grim Reaper!++++@++++No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper.
Where's the regular guy? Where's Doug?++++@++++Never mind. I'm Death now.
Oh man, these seats suck.++++@++++Leave everything to me.
Dad, were all those people on the list?++++@++++I'unno.
Thanks for not killing me, Homie. Here's an extra pork chop.++++@++++I'm gonna not kill you every week.
Sir, I'm honored to inform you that you've won the Nobel Prize.++++@++++The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?
This is Professor John Frink, isn't it?++++@++++If I say no, do I still win?
And I thought Halle Berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.++++@++++I wish I was Death again. That was cool.
Behold the perpetrators!++++@++++It was those guys!
Why is Bart so tall? And shaggy?++++@++++Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?
Why can't I tinker with the fabric of existence?++++@++++Let the baby have her bottle.
What happens if I press this button?++++@++++Lisa!
Sorry, sorry, sorry!++++@++++Okay, that's good! Stop there!
Don't go inside -- it's a trap!++++@++++Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!
Mayor unveils erection to cheering crowd. This week's "Oops Patrol" T-shirt goes to...++++@++++Whom? Whom?
Mom made the Oops Patrol! Hot damn!++++@++++Bart, you're not at school. Don't swear!
It could always be a little better.++++@++++Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness.
Dad, the word's "desert." And those farmers are suffering!++++@++++From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!
Don't drag me down with you, old man.++++@++++This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.
Oh, relax. I'm sure it's just your brain going crazy.++++@++++I wish! Look at this headline.
You always go with your gut. This time, why don't you listen to your brain?++++@++++All right, I will.
This is boring. Can't we go home? This overpass smells like urine.++++@++++They all do.
Fresh urine.++++@++++Hey, the bathroom's a block away.
Homer, you're hugging a bum.++++@++++I know! I'm working my way up to you.
Sorry about all the cloak and dagger Homer, but the government is still after me for what I did in the sixties. They're probably tapping your phones and reading your mail.++++@++++I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
To reach you, I called up my friends in the liberal media and planted that story about the giant pizza.++++@++++You sure know me, Mom.
I saw this macaroni pencil-holder Homer made me, and I realized how much I missed him.++++@++++I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
Not for someone who tips nine per cent.++++@++++Fine.
I'm sorry, my wife left me this morning.++++@++++Now, I'm not a man who's good with words...
You gotta say somethin', she's lookin' at twenty years. And my legal license expires in fifteen minutes.++++@++++I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me.
The jets in the whirlpool anticipated my every move. When it was working. And three dollars for a local call? They should be the ones on trial!++++@++++Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!
Well, now that I'm free, I intend to be a better mother to my son.++++@++++Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!
Oh, baby! Now you're free to come back to me!++++@++++Dad, you testified against her!
I read a book that said women like jerks.++++@++++Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!
Homer, this really isn't necessary.++++@++++You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it.
Oh well, you snooze you lose. But uh, can I have my photo albums back?++++@++++Now get out of my house.
Anita Bong-hitt?++++@++++No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!
Dad, I'm just as sad as you are. What happened to Grandma is an outrage.++++@++++How do you figure?
She was acquitted. Then they put her back in jail on a technicality.++++@++++You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
Well, they're transferring Grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. I say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!++++@++++Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.
Homer! What on Earth are you doing?++++@++++Mom, I love you! I can't let you go to prison!
He's a big one!++++@++++Oh, stop it.
Homer, get out now and no one will ever know you were involved.++++@++++No, you're my mother and I won't leave you!
If you stay here, you'll be abandoning your family the way I abandoned you.++++@++++Yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. But I'm not gonna leave you.
Pipe down, Jules Verne.++++@++++Go Mom! You can do it!
Mona, I'll always remember raspberry trolley cars... because my mind is shot.++++@++++Bear?!
Homer, it's two in the morning.++++@++++I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body.
Then what was in the coffin?++++@++++Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?
I really shouldn't be here -- I have a problem with games of chance. I played Candyland with Maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.++++@++++Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system.
That was always on too late for me.++++@++++I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
And the winner is, seventeen!++++@++++I win!
I'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people I don't like. Like you!++++@++++But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
I can't beat Nelson.++++@++++Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
I can't believe Nelson is more popular than me.++++@++++La, la, la...
No, I'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options...++++@++++My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!
Where did you get that tutu?++++@++++Clothesline.
Lisa, you look so successful. Like you're the wife of a businessman.++++@++++I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.
No. I was being sincere.++++@++++Oh, I'm so confused.
Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set.++++@++++On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars.
They made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.++++@++++Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps.
Would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?++++@++++No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!
Well, I guess this story has a happy ending after all. Just like my last massage.++++@++++I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!
But this is my dream.++++@++++Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?
Okay, let me take figure skating.++++@++++Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
Well, what can I be?++++@++++I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?
The best you'll ever have.++++@++++One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
No one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.++++@++++IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
Well... someday I'd like to go on a nice vacation.++++@++++We've gone on plenty of great vacations.
Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon.++++@++++I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
Well... okay. For Mom, I'll do it. Where should we go?++++@++++Well, I'd like to return to Brazil. But I hear the monkey problem is even worse now.
That sounds great -- But only if your father promises to behave.++++@++++Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?
Because I want to encourage all the world to come see the beauty of twenty-first century Britain.++++@++++Would an American dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
There's so much to see here: Parliament, Stratford-on-Avon, the white cliffs of Dover... Oh, and you Americans love castles -- there's a huge one in Edinburgh, the city where I was born.++++@++++The place I was born is now a gator farm.
I'd love to, but I'm late for an appointment. I'm greeting a lovely Dutch couple at Gate 23. Cheerio.++++@++++Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.
Actually, I'm not a butler. I had already hired this cab when you got in, but the more the merrier and all that.++++@++++Make with the tea, Jeeves.
I wouldn't dream of it, sir.++++@++++Thank you.
I don't know if I'm ever gonna find her.++++@++++Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do.
Now completely free of "Mad Fish Disease."++++@++++Fish? I don't know, I'm not really a vegetarian...
You punched out three people on the street.++++@++++That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?
Do you understand any part of what you just said?++++@++++I understand the word "gave." Unless it means something else in this country.
Homie, I don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here.++++@++++Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids.
It's a bet, Lord Daftwager.++++@++++You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!
Thank you, my dear. Please take these free tickets to my play.++++@++++What? What play?
We thespians believe it's bad luck to mention the name of this particular play out loud.++++@++++You mean "Macbeth"?
Quiet, you blundering fool. You'll curse us all!++++@++++What? By saying "Macbeth"?
Stop saying it!++++@++++Saying what?
Mom, you said Macbeth!++++@++++Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry.
Homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. This is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever.++++@++++Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful.
Turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning...++++@++++I see an opening.
We'll deal with him, your Majesty.++++@++++Your Majesty?
Dad, you rear-ended the Queen of England!++++@++++The Queen of whaaa?!
Changing of the guard!++++@++++Wait! We have to exchange insurance!
I guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.++++@++++Your Honor, I've completely disappointed my wife. That's punishment enough. You understand these things, you're a grandmother.
I'm a man!++++@++++Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord.
I haven't had an easy life. I've seen my country ravaged by war, my family torn by tragedy and then, as I was innocently making my way to the shops to buy light bulbs, I was blindsided by this great lumbering brute.++++@++++Boy, she's good. If she were a hundred years younger... and I were a hundred years older...
If there's any love left in you for me, destroy him.++++@++++America rules! Our Beatles are way better than your precious Rolling Stones!
Poke the monster with a stick! Tuppence a jab! C'mon, queue up, lads.++++@++++Oh Marge, I Am so sorry. I should've listened to whatever it was you were saying.
Hey, Dad, why don't we try the "Sprawl-Mart"?++++@++++Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!
We found a secret tunnel out of the tower. It was used by Sir Walter Raleigh!++++@++++A secret tunnel? I don't know. Won't that get me in more trouble?
Smash it on, don't worry it. Let the pike do the work.++++@++++Okay, what do I do?
Push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.++++@++++Sweet freedom, here I--
Put out the fire first.++++@++++Boy, it's a good thing I'm leaving before I went nuts. Goodbye Sparkly Elves.
Englishwomen don't pump gas naked!++++@++++See ya in Atlanta, jerk!
Mummy, he's everything you said he was.++++@++++Lady, you're gorgeous. You make Dame Edna look like a dude!
Flowers.++++@++++Flow... yeah.
Lis, your stupid present will only last a week. Mine will sit in a closet for years.++++@++++Bart, we made her the same thing!
This is even worse than you think -- look!++++@++++Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years.
Mighty Yamses, we are weary of building your food pyramid. Let my pickles go!++++@++++Mmm, Moses.
Grampa! You have a job?++++@++++How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads!++++@++++Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me.
Endorsed by the American Carny Association.++++@++++Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right.
All this attention! I feel like a secretary on Administrative Professionals Day!++++@++++Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap.
"Kitchen Carnival?" I love it! Thank you, Homie.++++@++++Whoa, Marge, get a room!
What is that?!++++@++++This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!
Homer, are you spooning that snack?++++@++++That's my old lady.
I think you should get rid of her. Then we can be together... forever!++++@++++Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge.
Homie! What happened to you?++++@++++Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it.
Dad, you got attacked by a bear?!++++@++++I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape.
Yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day.++++@++++Choke on your candor!
You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation.++++@++++It's a deal!
I'm an intensive care bear.++++@++++Why does a bear need a crowbar?
Crying in the corner huh? Mind if I join you?++++@++++No, go ahead.
All right. That's enough, Fraidy Sue. Here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back.++++@++++Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
It tracks an electronic tag I stuck in the bear's ear. It's the same technology they use to keep tabs on Gary Busey.++++@++++Finally, science has joined forces with revenge.
Oh, dear Lord.++++@++++Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack.
Homer, there's no rear on that thing.++++@++++I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit.
Now look here, mister. I forbid you to fight a bear.++++@++++What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?
Dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. That's the whole point of Moby Dick.++++@++++Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is "be yourself."
You're not going, and that's final.++++@++++Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
Or dead.++++@++++Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.
You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.++++@++++No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name.
Screw that. When I grow up, I'm legally changing my name to Joe Kickass.++++@++++That is so cool. All right, you can come.
Why don't you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.++++@++++Suh-weet.
SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT / AFTERNOON DELIGHT...++++@++++Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart?
A killer bear is on the loose in Springfield Forest, and local laughingstock Homer Simpson is missing and presumed mauled.++++@++++Wrong again, liberal media.
A bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars.++++@++++Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe.
You set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.++++@++++What can I say? I love nature...
I don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time.++++@++++Son, can I have cuts?
Maggie's locked inside!++++@++++Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
I tried the coat hanger again. I don't understand why we only try ideas once.++++@++++The door? Now I'll never get to pee.
Oh well, I'm glad you think they're cute, 'cause they're your problem now.++++@++++You just lost a box, pal!
We did -- Homer took him. Didn't you?++++@++++Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that...
Three hundred and fifty dollars an hour.++++@++++You're on!
...and so utterly repellant he...++++@++++I'm your man!
Now tonight's guest host... the ultimate place-holder... Homer Simpson!++++@++++Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show. I'm your host, Next Card. Homer Simpson it's great to be here in Next Card. Springfield my guests are...Moe Szyslak, local businessman, Carl Carlson, raconteur, and Lenny Leonard, three-time juror. Gentlemen, what's on your minds?
Dad, you have to say something. Something meaningful!++++@++++Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!
Yeah, yeah, twins, I get it. Now let's watch something I'm really interested in.++++@++++Who has more power? Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?
Uh, listen Homer. I'd like to raise an issue.++++@++++Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy.
About that, you know I've been with the show from the beginning and I was uh... I was wondering if I could get a small cost-of-living raise?++++@++++Interesting...
That light's a little bright. Do you think they could move it?++++@++++Please welcome my newest panelist, Disco Stu.
Ah, Simpson, I hate to bother you when you're eating, but you're always eating. Will you sign an autograph for my boy?++++@++++My pleasure.
I eat Legos.++++@++++So did I, son. And look where I am today.
It's great, Dad. You have tremendous power. And now it's time to put it to use.++++@++++Yes, you're right...
I say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse.++++@++++Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Boobs. Just like what girls got.++++@++++Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues.
Dad, you blew it. You listened to Lisa. And then you lost your stranglehold on the audience.++++@++++I'll audience you!
Oh, Homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. I'm proud of you.++++@++++Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me.
Come on, Homie. We'll go to the "Make Your Own Sundae" place.++++@++++Will you make my sundae for me?
... ha.mo.shel be.khol-a.sher-lo sim-na yad.kha ta.khat ...++++@++++I'm hungry. Are they married yet?
They're not getting married!++++@++++Then whose garter is this?
The real Kent is in a rehab clinic. We all wish him the best -- again.++++@++++I love the holiday season.
Hey, Homer -- I'm your Secret Santa. Merry Christmas, big guy.++++@++++Oh my God! A DVD player.
And the first season of Magnum P.I. with commentary by John Hillerman. Apparently, working in Hawaii was a pleasure.++++@++++Oh Carl, you remembered I like TV!
I think it's Homer.++++@++++Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room.
Homer, you're the most selfish man I know.++++@++++Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.
All right, everyone. It's time for your Christmas "boni." Everyone gets a five dollar cafeteria voucher...and for your boy, a confectioner's card featuring a current baseballer. It's that rookie from the New York Nine.++++@++++Joe DiMaggio?
Deftly.++++@++++Thank you! Freak.
This is offensive to Christians and prunes.++++@++++Hey, everybody! We're going shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade!
It also comes with a notepad and a pen that works upside down.++++@++++I'm upside down so much!
Today is the birthday of comedienne Margaret Cho.++++@++++That's the birthday I'm always forgetting. I must have it!
Can we get our big Christmas tree now?++++@++++Uh, sure, you know it. The biggest tree from the finest lot in town!
Dad, I don't like the looks of this neighborhood.++++@++++It's fine. Everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio.
Colombia's main export is coffee.++++@++++Exactly.
Isn't it kind of dry?++++@++++Oh, it just needs a little love.
You wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!++++@++++There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you.
I will be testing my smoke alarm for the next three hours.++++@++++Oh, this is sadder than "Tuesdays With Morrie."
You just don't get it, do you? Christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself.++++@++++That's not true. I cared what you thought once you found out.
You can sleep on the couch tonight.++++@++++Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
And now back to "Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol."++++@++++Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man.
I can't find my way back to the home.++++@++++I heard you the first five times.
Sweet, sweet money!++++@++++Oh my God! It's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
Spirit, surely there is some time to reform my selfish ways.++++@++++C'mon, Death. Leave McGrew alone. Take Tiny Tim.
Dad? Are you okay?++++@++++Children, children, what day is this?
It's Saturday, December sixth.++++@++++Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!
That last one looked kinda good.++++@++++Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town.
You've made that promise before.++++@++++Yes, but this time I'm sober. Ish.
Well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans.++++@++++No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes.
These pants smell worse than my old pants.++++@++++You're welcome!
Wow, a photo cube with pictures of us!++++@++++And I filed down all the sharp corners. See, your eye is completely safe.
Oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. And tears are the sweetest sauce.++++@++++All right, now you're startin' to creep me out.
Oh, very nice, Ned. But I'm afraid you're a distant second this week.++++@++++I'm not looking for glory or wealth. I'm just buying that stairway to heaven Jesus sang of.
That was Led Zeppelin.++++@++++Get back to your bong, hippie.
Homie, I'm so proud -- you changed more than I could imagined! You're even covering your mouth when you burp.++++@++++Just like the Pope!
Wha?++++@++++Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots.
Those are my feet.++++@++++Ewww.
You just tweezered my wang.++++@++++I'll show Flanders. I'm gonna get everyone a car. What's that one good American car?
Dad, you don't have to out-do Mr. Flanders. Just remember the spirit of the season.++++@++++Uh... is it despair?
Actually, most people now feel Christmas has gotten too materialistic. In fact, as a Buddhist, I believe people would be a lot happier without presents.++++@++++Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.
I'm not going to jail again!++++@++++I've got it... when everyone's asleep, I'll take away their presents. Then they'll be happy! Thanks, Buddha.
Your behavior, it's like, it's like, not sanctioned by any governing body. You're like, wild.++++@++++Um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?
Friends, what Homer did was wrong. But I've been thinking -- maybe I was just as wrong to give you those gifts.++++@++++Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!
You can't pray on city property.++++@++++Let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. But we're probably right. Amen.
Amen.++++@++++And now, I think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! Ned?
NINE, TEN, START OVER AGAIN. ONE, TWO, TIE YOUR SHOE....++++@++++Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!
I got them fair and square and I kept my dignity. Not like Janey's mom.++++@++++Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!
That ad makes me look like a criminal.++++@++++Then why did you appear in it?
That wasn't me!++++@++++Maybe she was you and you're not! How many kids do we have?
Three!++++@++++Wrong, lady! Oh wait, the baby.
I try my best. They ridicule me. They mock everything I cherish.++++@++++Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich.
You're my rock, Homie.++++@++++And I promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
Awww...++++@++++Honey, no one messes with my Mrs. I'll come down on those guys like the garage door on Bart's bike.
What are you going to do?++++@++++You just leave everything to Homer. And now, I believe you owe me half a sandwich.
I always keep one near the bed for you.++++@++++Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four...
I probably should have watched it first.++++@++++You've probably heard a lot of bad things about Families Come First.
It says "Yes on two thirty-two". We want no on two thirty-two, Yes on two forty-two.++++@++++Either way. The important thing is the system works.
And the bumper stickers misspelled "on".++++@++++Great. Let's dump these kids in an R-rated movie while we go someplace nice.
I need to be alone right now.++++@++++Marge, wait.
Can I bring my laser pointer?++++@++++What do I care?
I ran here as fast as I...++++@++++Bart, that creepy kid's here!
I said no!++++@++++I'm confused! Which is it?
It's no! His old bike is fine!++++@++++Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works.
I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one?++++@++++That's right. No questions asked.
I know how you feel, Lis. No kid wants to outlive their pet.++++@++++There, there. You're both right.
Can I, for true?++++@++++For true, son.
Your bike is in here. I could put it together right now -- for a small assembly fee.++++@++++Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
Dad, no! Think of the bike.++++@++++I can make a bike. I made you.
Yeah, great workmanship.++++@++++Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day.
Haw haw! Your dad's not handy!++++@++++Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access!
Face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. But you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. That's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news.++++@++++First of all, thank you. Secondly...
If you can't build a robot... be a robot!++++@++++That's it!
Awesome! I gotta tell Milhouse.++++@++++Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag.
Oh, Lisa. Honey, it's okay. You're a Buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life.++++@++++Like a dog. Or a snowman!
Dear Bart...++++@++++"...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad.
What's this? Knockahomer has dropped his hammer.++++@++++Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!++++@++++Pretended.
Dad, what are all those cuts?++++@++++Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.
Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!++++@++++I like you, son.
This robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. I can't believe you've never seen him fight.++++@++++Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank.
Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then?++++@++++I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think.
Our robot can kick that robot's ass! Right Dad? Dad?++++@++++Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!
You guys are just in time. My dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.++++@++++Uh...
Don't worry, I'll raise him like the mean streets raised me.++++@++++I wish I had bullies like you growing up.
My job was to keep Lisa's hope alive. But instead, she's really depressed.++++@++++You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!
Business, what business?++++@++++The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?
Dad?!++++@++++Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud.
So, you fought all those robots?++++@++++Affirmative.
That is so cool!++++@++++You really think so?
Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world.++++@++++And I'm the luckiest--
That robot has given birth to a man!++++@++++Hey, what gives? He's not killing me!
I'll tell you what gives, I'm afraid he is subject to Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics. With the sci-fi and the so many books, not too many good. My robot is programmed never to harm humans, you see, only to serve them.++++@++++He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.
Go! Go! Go! Now's your chance!++++@++++Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.
Why did you make it do that?++++@++++Keep me focused.
Well, you did disappear a lot, but I have gone whole summers without seeing you.++++@++++Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable.
I could also deep-fry the bag.++++@++++Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.
Yes, we're well-protected against every threat, from bomb-toting Bolsheviks, to golden-armed jazzbos.++++@++++Oh no! I hit the grief counselor!
Consider yourself fired!++++@++++I had a car!
Okay, here's how it goes: buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend. And when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror.++++@++++We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
Let's get outta here. I'm not shaking that guy's hand.++++@++++They'll be back.
Buy me! Buy me! Buy me! Buy me!++++@++++I'll do it!
You work at the nuclear plant.++++@++++Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!
Don't you need training for that?++++@++++Maybe on planet ZooZoo.
Not if I pump your heart full of morphine first!++++@++++Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake.
Tonight? But I was hoping you could watch the kids while I work on my novel.++++@++++Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?
Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call.++++@++++I also fed some ducklings.
I know -- I got your message.++++@++++Fine, fine. I'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment.
I'm writing a novel!++++@++++Whatever. But I think you look great already.
For the third time, the hospital. You're an ambulance, not a taxi!++++@++++Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight.
Why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?++++@++++Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?
Oh Homie, I've had the most exciting day...++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons.
We're not paramedics!++++@++++I'll say.
I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.++++@++++Marge! We're out of bath towels.
Homie, I finished my novel.++++@++++Ooh, typed!
It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.++++@++++No problem.
It's double-spaced.++++@++++Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!
Did you read the book?++++@++++Oh, yes.
Did you like it?++++@++++I did.
Oh that's wonderful. And the characters didn't bother you at all?++++@++++No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.
And you're fine with me trying to get it published?++++@++++As I've always said: "publish or perish"!
We're doomed.++++@++++So, how much bleach did you drink? Not a talker, eh?
Oh Mr. Homer, anything for a cuckolded boob, I mean, loyal customer.++++@++++What are you talking about?
Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an "active imagination."++++@++++Why do you keep talking that way?!
You'll see when you read your wife's book.++++@++++Well, then maybe I will.
If you do you'll see she lusts for Flanders.++++@++++That one I got.
The Harpooned Heart II: Thunder Down Under. Chapter One. Temperance Barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...++++@++++How can you write such horrible things about me?
You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!++++@++++I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
Well... there is a place called Nantucket.++++@++++I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?
It was only my imagination.++++@++++Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again.
Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box.++++@++++Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago.
Advice? Just call me Ann Flanders!++++@++++Uh-huh.
...and a backrub can just be a backrub. It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.++++@++++Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good.
Oh, Homie! You're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book.++++@++++That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book.
That's the best review I've gotten. Seriously. These reviews are terrible.++++@++++Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.
Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel.++++@++++All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee.
Mom, that sounds a lot like the movie "Amadeus," which was historically inaccurate. Mozart worked hard on his music... Salieri was a respected composer...++++@++++All I know is the guy who played Mozart was also in "Animal House." Now there's a movie with good music. ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... / NOBODY EVER WENT TO CLASS... / THEN WE SAW DONALD SUTHERLAND'S ASS... / ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... /
We suck!++++@++++A lot of that went in my lungs.
Attention American bar devils: it's our anniversary! Free drinks for everyone!++++@++++That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina.
What did you plan to get your wife, Homer?++++@++++These charity address labels that came in the mail.
Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. If you make it through the night, you're welcome back.++++@++++Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.
Oh, you poor soul. You think that rat is a remote.++++@++++Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money!
Homie, they're beautiful. That Chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! I feel a swoon coming on... Here it is!++++@++++I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out!
Oh, fine.++++@++++Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.
Oh, you poor man. You smell worse than you did last time.++++@++++Hm...
Hey buddy, that's nice sign work. Your penmanship is clear yet sad.++++@++++Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup.
Oh yeah, yeah. You know, number two and number four are an item now.++++@++++You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?
I think you would do well with "crazy guy."++++@++++Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!
Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work.++++@++++Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you...
I also found this in your drawer.++++@++++All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!
Are these Diamondique?++++@++++Nope.
Diamondelle?++++@++++Nope.
Cubic Diamondium?++++@++++Nope.
Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?++++@++++Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds.
Hostess Twinkies?++++@++++I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor.
Go ride bikes for a while, huh.++++@++++Yeah, you heard your mother.
You got your wife the earrings, man. Why are you still doin' this?++++@++++I want to get a second house. Closer to work.
You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling.++++@++++But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice...
And to remind you of what you've done, I'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.++++@++++I don't understand.
What're you talkin' about?++++@++++When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.
All yours, Homer.++++@++++You didn't sit on the toilet!
Didn't have to, I'm a dude.++++@++++Butt on bowl, little man!
Hey, my-my pants aren't down!++++@++++It doesn't matter!
What's all that racket?!++++@++++It's old lady Simpson! Run!
They just painted the tower brown.++++@++++Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish.
It's application day at Miss Wickerbottom's Pre-Nursery School.++++@++++Pre-nursery school?!
You know, Marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby.++++@++++Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!
I will hire a collection agency.++++@++++Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!
Maggie, we're not a mime school, so we can't take a non-talker, but here's some good news: the Gap will always need sweater-folders.++++@++++I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship.
My baby has no future!++++@++++Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer...
Grocers don't make that much.++++@++++...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez.
Maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. C'mon.++++@++++I'm taking you all out for tacos!
Well, congratulations. You're now as intelligent as a pig. Let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family?++++@++++Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!
Go, Maggie!++++@++++Go, Seminoles!
Yes, thank you.++++@++++So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids.
'Got Your Nose' And Other Lies...++++@++++If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. I'm slappin' this sucker right over "Support Our Troops."
Well, then... find a new identity.++++@++++Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!
All right, if I'm second rate as the smart kid, I'll find a new raison d'Ãªtre.++++@++++That still sounds like the smart kid.
Huh. Oh. Muh. Eh. Er.++++@++++That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
This-is-Huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. He's-too-sick-to-work-today.++++@++++I'll be right back.
I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set!++++@++++Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?
Giant tongue.++++@++++Oh, I knew it!
Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button!++++@++++Hit the red button!
Maggie! Press the red button!++++@++++I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!
Lisa! You're all right!++++@++++Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!
You can do it. Red!++++@++++Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere.
Uh-hmm.++++@++++Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food.
I believe I can answer that.++++@++++How'd you get in here?
I'm afraid your daughter is no longer welcome at our school. She's as common as an angry woman in an Ibsen play.++++@++++Zing.
She could be... at sweeping up hair.++++@++++That's my baby, jerk.
But they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!++++@++++I am so there!
Sorry, pally, the Dingleberries are sold out. But looking at you, I'm sure your kids are used to disappointment.++++@++++How 'bout "Diet Coke -- the Movie?"... "President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?"... "My Big Fat Greek Salad?"
Sold out... Sorry... Not a movie. The only movies starting now are "The Re-deadening" and "Teenage Sex Wager."++++@++++Ooh, well, I am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. And the wager only sweetens the deal.
Mr. Simpson, that movie is condemned by our church's movie guide.++++@++++What Would Jesus View?
Ah, two for "The Re-deadening," please.++++@++++The Re-deadening? Is that any good?
Classic Hollywood story -- the director saw my photo in a medical book.++++@++++Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?
Oh yeah, there are lots of kids in it! They fall victim to a vicious--++++@++++Don't ruin it for me! One adult and four children for "The Re-deadening."
Mr. Simpson, I'm scared.++++@++++Relax, stupid. Everything you see is make believe. Although it is based on a true story. Some of which happened in this very theater.
Dad, I don't like this movie. Can we go home?++++@++++Oh honey, don't be scared. Look, they killed the evil doll.
Homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you.++++@++++But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
Homie, that Kojak is sexier than Cannon and Barnaby Jones put together. I think he looks a little like you.++++@++++Who loves ya, baby?
How about a little "interrogation?"++++@++++Okay. You have the right to remain sexy. Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. If you cannot afford a sex-torney--
None other! I've been hiding in your attic -- living off the moisture I can suck from the rafters!++++@++++I thought we killed him!
That's right. Twice a week I get your email of the monkey peeing in his own mouth.++++@++++Oh yeah. That monkey got America through some tough times.
Forgive me. I'm just so envious of the happiness you all have. Can I please be part of it, just 'til I get back on my feet?++++@++++No way! He's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
Oh my. Well, Homer, maybe you should take him to Moe's.++++@++++C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight.
I fold. / Me too. / I'm out. / I'm done.++++@++++I'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
Well, I'm out of cash. But would you accept ninety-eight per cent of the outstanding shares of ZiffCorp stock?++++@++++And the peanuts in your mouth.
Achem!++++@++++All of them.
Flush. What have you got?++++@++++Four jacks.
It's scum like you that undermine investor confidence.++++@++++Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.
You're the majority shareholder?++++@++++I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
All right, I admit it. I did run ZiffCorp into the ground. Then this man took me into his home when no one else would. And now, as a result of his brilliant card playing he's the one you want! Tape his mouth so he can't deny it!++++@++++Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!
Homer Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that your company has betrayed the public trust?++++@++++Plead the fifth amend-what?
Oh, for heaven's sakes!++++@++++Your majesty, can I go home now?
Sorry you were wrongfully imprisoned, Simpson.++++@++++Can I apply my time toward a future crime?
Oh Dad, I missed you so much.++++@++++Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!
Homer, I believe that's Lisa.++++@++++Oh Bart, what a man you've become.
I have to admit, I'll miss having him around.++++@++++I don't think we've seen the last of Artie Ziff.
Trebulon Minor...?++++@++++Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.
Kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? That's how I got the Channel Six weather girl to start wearing a bra.++++@++++That was you!?
I'll write the letter.++++@++++Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!
We're gonna have to track Randall Curtis down and make him listen to us.++++@++++And I know just where to find him. 742 Evergreen Terrace.
Dad, that's our address.++++@++++He's in the house?
Well, northern California is wine country -- we could take a tour.++++@++++And it's a perfect time... I just got fired again.
Enjoy your tour, and take it easy on Mr. Curtis. Your father and I will be across the street at The Lush Valley Winery.++++@++++Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?
We should do more together. You're my best friend, Homie.++++@++++Well yeah, legally. But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?
The doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter.++++@++++Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!
The Mediterranean climate is reproduced by cool Pacific winds, mixed with exhaust fumes from the highway.++++@++++Ahh, summer in Tuscany.
Mmm, it goes great with the Jolly Rancher I'm sucking on!++++@++++Pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either.
"Fox Broadcasting, 10201 West Pico, Building 203..."++++@++++I drank this much!
Homie, to store the extra wine we bought, I made a little wine cellar.++++@++++Ooh! Can I have my special cup?
Homie, you are so cute.++++@++++Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh.
I don't talk like that.++++@++++Yes you do.
Moe's Tavern? That's your fun place, like me and the lamp store.++++@++++Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says.
Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide.++++@++++All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel.
Did you guys get home at two last night?++++@++++Yep. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple. Like Scott and Zelda Munster!
Do you have to make such an unholy racket?++++@++++Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time.
Maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.++++@++++No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.
Okay... and maybe you could cut back too.++++@++++You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible.
I hope I can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.++++@++++Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing.
Eins, zwei, drei, beer!++++@++++Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em.
Isn't that a little big?++++@++++You can just nurse it.
Have you ever walked on stilts? It's not that great.++++@++++Yes, and you've said that several times now.
Eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out.++++@++++I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.
Are we home yet?++++@++++In a minute, honey.
I can't believe I drove drunk.++++@++++But you do believe it, right?
I don't know what to believe anymore.++++@++++That's my girl!
Where's your wife tonight, Homer?++++@++++She's not coming anymore.
What? It's 'cause of her I put in a bidet. Well, it's actually just a step ladder by the water fountain.++++@++++Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love.
Hey, look. I've been in the bartender business for a long time alright, I've heard it all.++++@++++Well, what I did was...
What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up.++++@++++Can I have some peanuts?
Cash bribes only.++++@++++Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI...
Oh, thank God. You're finally fighting your demons.++++@++++My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.
Well, that's good too, I guess.++++@++++Feed my pets and tape my shows!
Where's the package?++++@++++Dammit!
You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?++++@++++Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you.
I can't believe you did that to me.++++@++++That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?
Yes, I really don't think you two should leave. He's a chronic alcoholic and you're in complete denial.++++@++++Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown.
Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking.++++@++++Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke.
It's important for me to see you take at least one step. Then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.++++@++++All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors.
Really? Even Zima?++++@++++Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk.
You really mean it?++++@++++Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible.
The basement, sir.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. Homer!++++@++++So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.
Sir...other customers need to use that dressing room.++++@++++Dressing room? Uh oh.
We've already got an informer working deep cover on your dad. One he'll never suspect.++++@++++Is it Lenny?
My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.++++@++++It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you.
You're a great mom. You were always there for Bart with love and support. His acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.++++@++++Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler.
Time's up!++++@++++My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.
So, why do you want to be a guard here?++++@++++I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
This end's for beating, this end's for holding.++++@++++Uh-huh. When does training start?
Keep away! Keep away!++++@++++Put that sissy down!
His dad's a screw?++++@++++I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge.
Not so tough now, huh?++++@++++Well, that's the end of my shift.
Why would Bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?++++@++++You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.
But he won't know where to go or what to eat.++++@++++Relax, what's the worst that could happen?
I can't wait to lay my eggs in his brain.++++@++++No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
Oh Bart, my troubled little lamb. You'll be in jail for so long. But I'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty.++++@++++Son, I want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive.
We're having "make your own taco" night.++++@++++Gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of Christmas.
Homie, what are you doing?++++@++++I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's.
I'm gonna sleep on the couch.++++@++++She sure loves that couch.
Homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. Would you please return my pants and/or underpants so I can go home?++++@++++Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun.
Grinch.++++@++++Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong.
You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield.++++@++++What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?
Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I'm starting to get cold feet. Please don't tell anyone.++++@++++Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
Homer, you're still talking to me!++++@++++Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here.
Principal Skinner is having second thoughts? Poor Edna!++++@++++Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up.
Every day you find a new way to aggravate me.++++@++++Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage.
Spice up! Spice up!++++@++++Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart.
I think Skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.++++@++++Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter.
Cowabunga One to Fat Load.++++@++++This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
Denied.++++@++++Okay, Fat Load here.
That cloud looks awesome. That rock looks awesome. My hands look awesome.++++@++++Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?
This is so sad.++++@++++Yeah, he's crazy all right.
Drink or I'll die.++++@++++Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.
That was before I missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!++++@++++Don't worry, Principal Skinner.
Edna, the Klingons have a romantic saying: .++++@++++Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say.
Really? You'll be my Cyrano?++++@++++Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to.
Oh, that's so lovely. But it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!++++@++++Marge? Are you helping her?
I won't let Edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die.++++@++++Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?
Homer, Marge, if I could just speak to Edna for a moment.++++@++++Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!
Just why am I taking your advice?++++@++++Because I'm successfully married.
There's no ring on that finger.++++@++++Uh-oh.
As tuned as we're gonna get in this humidity.++++@++++And the castrati?
The what now?++++@++++And a one and a two and a...
Oh, but it can. I adore Edna: she is near-mint and comes from a very limited edition -- females who will talk to me.++++@++++Give her back to Skinner! A fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
Edna's with Comic Book Guy? Oh God, she's on the rebound! And you meet the worst guys on the rebound. It's how Jackie got her "O"!++++@++++Okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my Lois Lane comics, buy some Jimmy Olsens, and stop Edna from making a terrible mistake!
I wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat.
They're going into Multi-Purpose Room B!++++@++++That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.
At least I was planned.++++@++++Okay Marge, I hear ya. Now that Krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems.
Our marriage is just an illusion. He doesn't care how I feel at all. He doesn't know how to love.++++@++++Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one.
A band in a closet! Every girl's dream.++++@++++And now, Padre, if you would do the honors.
Please don't make us go. If you make me get on that plane, I'll give myself diarrhea! I know how!++++@++++Okay, don't go. Just stay here and rot with Grampa.
I'm only rotting on the right side.++++@++++I'll right-side you!
I'm sorry sir, the computer says the movie "Chocolate Star Wars" doesn't exist.++++@++++I say you don't exist!
A chick flick? Say it ain't so, Ho!++++@++++Can I have both?
Like what? They'll do something with you that they hate?++++@++++Exactly.
THE SWEET LOVE STORY THAT IS OLDER THAN THE SEA...++++@++++THE SIMPLE SOMETHING THAT DUM DEEDLE DUM DEE DEE... / NOW LET'S PUSH PLAAAY!
Opinion noted. Now if you don't mind, your father and I are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy.++++@++++Yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the Hell up!
Homie, if I died, would you be sad?++++@++++Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy.
Stupid kids ruin everything.++++@++++So, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?
Homie, you know I'm usually good for a triple-X throw down, but between those kids and going to Uncle Tyrone's, we can't be alone.++++@++++We're alone now.
You're never alone in this crapshack!++++@++++Why you little...
Honeymooners -- no kids, no worries.++++@++++Here's your future!
Not me, I do crunches.++++@++++Remember our honeymoon?
You know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to Miami!++++@++++Marge, let's do it.
What about Uncle Tyrone?++++@++++We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!
So we're upgrading you to First Class.++++@++++There's a first class?
This is so luxurious! I feel like I'm Princess Grace and Princess Di smashed together!++++@++++And look at me, I'm reading "The Economist." Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?
Yeah, I've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone.++++@++++And tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump.
Seriously, with the new breast pumps, and Diaper Genies, and corporate flex-time, child-rearing oughta be a snap!++++@++++You keep thinking that!
The kids tracked us down! Our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.++++@++++Marge, I won't let that happen. We have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. Not 'til Lisa's in college and we've lost contact with Bart.
You're right, but where do we go?++++@++++I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
Homie, people in the other elevators can see us.++++@++++Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag.
Homie, the waiter's still here.++++@++++Oh, right.
Thank you, sir.++++@++++And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course.
Let me finish my sentence!++++@++++Never!
I don't know... Homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?++++@++++Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!
You've been to space.++++@++++And yet, I've never been to me.
Tonight... we reveal a shocking secret.++++@++++No one does that to my daughter!
What did those women expect? When you sign a contract with Fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated.++++@++++Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV.
Do you love that sooo-weet smell of Farmer Billy's bacon?++++@++++Do I ever!
Would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?++++@++++Would I!
If you like bacon, you're gonna love it. And if you don't like bacon, well then the hell with you.++++@++++I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
Okay, Farmer Billy's slow-killed bacon, Farmer Billy's bacon-fed bacon, Farmer Billy's travel bacon... Mr. Simpson, if you really want to kill yourself, I also sell handguns.++++@++++Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.
Please, Mr. Simpson, please. I fear your smooches are premature. This is, in fact, a silver ticket.++++@++++Huh?
"This silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the Springfield County Fair."++++@++++Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?
This song is about a country I love -- you may have heard of it. It's called America.++++@++++Hey, I know that country!
BUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY / TO ME SHE HAS NO SINS / IF YOU DON'T BUY MY RECORD / THEN AL QAEDA WINS!++++@++++USA! USA!
Of all the days for you to get a zit.++++@++++Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
One more felony assault, Simpson, and you're goin' down. I didn't know I could fit in a bubble. I must be losin' weight.++++@++++But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.
Shall we ever see Springfield's costumed protector again?++++@++++Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!
I'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the Pie Man.++++@++++That's really sweet, honey.
Dad, I feel like I'm gonna throw up.++++@++++What's wrong, son?
He was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.++++@++++Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie.
No, I think the expression is "peg."++++@++++Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie.
Oh brother. Why do we get all the weirdos here at the comic book store?++++@++++Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
You can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.++++@++++Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot.
Ooh, I'll bet he's Ned Flanders.++++@++++Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.
Pie -- popular pastry, tricky math thing, and now, sword of righteousness. A masked avenger has been giving Springfield's scoundrels their just desserts.++++@++++This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
Pie Man, no! It's a trap!++++@++++No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!
Shoot to kill!++++@++++Dammit!
That was so exciting, yet familiar. Like Coke with lemon.++++@++++Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet.
Dad, please. It's obvious you're Pie Man. We've been getting his mail for weeks.++++@++++We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
Dad, this is the basement. Here's the iced tea I left down here this afternoon.++++@++++So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson...
You're not mild-mannered. You're often liquored-up and rude.++++@++++Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?
I want you to stop this, Dad. Before you get killed.++++@++++All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?
Well, I know one thing you could do...++++@++++I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food.
Simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! I'm docking you a day's pay.++++@++++I'll show him.
Don't do it, Homer! You made a promise to Lisa!++++@++++Since when do I listen to cakes?
Tell you what, Homer -- you make one last hit, then you're out of the business forever. Lisa would understand.++++@++++You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.
Again?++++@++++I've run out of pie-related puns!
Simpson! You'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!++++@++++It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!
Wait, I have a better idea. You'll work for me now.++++@++++I already work for you.
In addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man.++++@++++Do I get two paychecks?
Do as I say or I'll tell the police. You'll do so much community service.++++@++++Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!
Now open the folder. It contains your next victim.++++@++++No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved.
Oh, me too...++++@++++What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?
Homie... are you the Pie Man?++++@++++No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it.
Now, on a different subject, kiss me hard.++++@++++You know I'm not Pie Man.
Girl Scout cookies!++++@++++Oh come on, she's a little girl.
Now pie that Brownie, fruitcake!++++@++++Sorry.
Ga-ga. Goo-goo. Your assignment.++++@++++The Dalai Lama!
As Springfield's youngest Buddhist, I am deeply honored to introduce the Dalai Lama.++++@++++I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?
C'mon, Pie Man, hit him! That's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!++++@++++No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape from this nightmare.
Yeah, and Homer's a dumbass! No offense, Homer. Ya dumbass.++++@++++I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!
Dad, I think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to.++++@++++Yeah. Let's go home, honey.
I know one person who believes you were the Pie Man, Homie... me. I've known it all along.++++@++++Was it the kiss?
So... Pie Man, why don't you show me your superpowers? Pie Man?++++@++++Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!
Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson.++++@++++Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?
Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?++++@++++Permission to treat this witness as hostile.
Your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.++++@++++Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you.
Yes... and then your father broke my heart. And if I'd known he was you, I never would have married you!++++@++++Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess.
Granted.++++@++++Whee! Recess!
Let me get this straight. When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it? That's cool. Or is it lame? I guess I'll go with lame. You're lame.++++@++++Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.
I've kissed three girls.++++@++++I'm so lame!
You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.++++@++++Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?
Oh, I'm sure it's a much nicer name than Homer.++++@++++Think, Homer, think.
What did you say?++++@++++I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.
No, no, I'd best be on me way. I'll just take some Teddy Grahams for the road.++++@++++There goes a good friend.
The perfect kiss!++++@++++It was pretty delicious.
But then your father showed his true colors.++++@++++Whuh-oh.
Ha ha! You said "dog doo"!++++@++++She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up...
Sweet, sweet poison. Uh-oh.++++@++++Kids love trains.
I can't believe I went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.++++@++++Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?
If you are who I think you are, that girl is gone and she never wants to see you again.++++@++++She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
Was that special?++++@++++No.
Homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant.++++@++++What about now?
Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. I guess it didn't mean that much to you.++++@++++That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.
I wish there was some way I could believe that.++++@++++All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.
Oh, Homie! You did care.++++@++++I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.
Oh, Elvis.++++@++++Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge.
Make mine calico!++++@++++Here you go.
Well, that just leaves Bart.++++@++++Don't forget Maggie!
Whoa, something's wrong! Ah, ah, I can't hear!++++@++++Doctor! Perform a diagnosis!
The boy's hearing should clear up in a day. If it doesn't, call me in the Bahamas. For now, he can express himself with this complimentary pen.++++@++++Cool!
Dad, he's deaf.++++@++++Oh, sorry, right.
Donkey Basketball? Now I've heard everything! Unlike you!++++@++++Everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
Your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of America's only losing war.++++@++++To date!
Goodbye, Homer. I can't get drunk and vomit next to a guy I don't respect.++++@++++Even my best friends have left me! I'm all alone!
We've become pariahs! In the last two hours I've gotten one thousand hate spams.++++@++++Y'ello. Appear on your TV show?! Tell our side of the story?! You'll see us there?! Goodbye?! Dial tone?!
We get it, Mom.++++@++++No, no, no, let her finish.
Look, what should I say to make people not hate me?++++@++++Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat.
Dad, I am going on a talk show. I have to say something!++++@++++Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't.
But I don't hate this country.++++@++++There there, save your lies for the American public.
If by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, I do hate Americans!++++@++++What'd you say?
Martha! Play something to lighten the mood!++++@++++BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKERJACK... / I DON'T CARE IF... OW!
Well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride.++++@++++Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
Well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. Check out all the left-wing celebrities.++++@++++Bill Clinton? What are you doin' here?
Homer, we've got to get outta here.++++@++++Yeah, yeah. Next commercial.
I know a way out.++++@++++Who are you?
I'm the last registered democrat. Tax and spend! Tax and spend! Now, if you want to escape, you can do it during the prison talent show tomorrow night.++++@++++I don't want to be in any stupid talent show. Not without my Tennessee walking horses.
You guys are on after Al Franken, so the guards will have used up most of their bullets. Make your break at the end of your act.++++@++++Now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. But you can't spell U.S.A. without us... eh?
O BEAUTIFUL / FOR SPACIOUS SKIES / FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN...++++@++++FIFTY STARS AND THIRTEEN STRIPES...
MY CARD HERE SAYS "ACLU" / NOW LOOK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO...++++@++++TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY IS NO CHORE...
WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR OUR ENCORE...++++@++++We mean it, don't move.
Dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?++++@++++Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!
Does everyone remember their swimming lessons?++++@++++Yes.
Swim toward San Francisco!++++@++++I'm not made of money! We'll swim to Oakland.
There's a ship! We're saved!++++@++++Oh, what's the use? Even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate America. I don't want to end up like Elmo, hanging himself in prison.
The food is so delicious here. And these Chanel suits are five for a dollar! I'm using a jacket as a napkin.++++@++++And here no one calls me a fat jerk... I'm a gourmand!
I wish we could go back, but I don't think we're welcome there.++++@++++No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D.
Name?++++@++++Simpson.
From now on, you're the Simps!++++@++++Ooh, that'll save some time.
Today, Geezer Rock will be officially designated a national landmark!++++@++++Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.
He's got a tree in his eye!++++@++++If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?
You don't sell roadside corn.++++@++++There's a lot you don't know about me, Marge. A lot that would shock you.
But I didn't read my poem!++++@++++Here's a poem: "run fast, or lose your ass"!
Well, at least some good came out of today.++++@++++Bart, you're grounded for a year.
I'll just pay the fine.++++@++++Okay, three bucks.
Publish it myself? Why not? I could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. I'd be a publisher, just like Katherine Graham!++++@++++Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
Thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of The Red Dress Press, Dad.++++@++++I'm always happy to help you, sweetie.
Dad! Mr. Burns cut our power -- now I can't print my paper!++++@++++These batteries have to power everything in our house!
So, has your daughter always been such a righteous little rabble-rouser?++++@++++Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind.
Fascinating. Do go on.++++@++++Wait a minute. Are you trying to get dirt on Lisa?
You saw right through me. Well done! Have some congratulatory drugs.++++@++++Well, if that's your custom.
Now, tell me more about your daughter. And speak into the lamp.++++@++++Okay.
Liberal whacko, eh? Any young beaux?++++@++++Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?
Dad, how could you say these things?++++@++++I'm so sorry, honey. I said good things about you too. Check out the Lifestyle section: "Plastic pearls make the girl."
Take my wallet and leave me alone!++++@++++Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this.
Look at you go. Type-ity type, type, type!++++@++++Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers.
The Homer Times?++++@++++"All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude."
Check out the Willie World News: I review the new tractors. They're all shite!++++@++++See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions.
Am I the only one here who's in horrible pain?++++@++++You're the only one who won't shut up about it.
My, you look awfully pale. Let's get you some fresh air.++++@++++And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?
Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.++++@++++Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?
Homer, I can foretell people's deaths!++++@++++People's deaths, eh?
Uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich.++++@++++What kind of bread?
Country parmesan.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Don't worry, sweetie. I am not going to kill your father.++++@++++Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three.++++@++++Hey Chief, throw me your piece.
Uh, sure thing, citizen.++++@++++C'mon, shoot me a new one!
Quit whackin' my barrel!++++@++++Never!
Homer, stay away from the nuclear plant.++++@++++Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake.
But you're gonna kill us all...++++@++++But ice cream cake...
Do it! Do it! Kill everyone!++++@++++It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
Homer, I am so mad at you! I'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!++++@++++Everything's comin' up Homer.
Yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. The garage made it to Heaven too!++++@++++Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?
Your Frisbee.++++@++++Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
Oh yeah. Just stay away from the three bean salad.++++@++++You're not the boss of me.
Prior to ingestion, the pill must be reduced by my amazing new shrink ray.++++@++++Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy.
Bio-nauts assemble!++++@++++Captain!
Now, you must enter the subclavian vein!++++@++++Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut.
Dad, you should listen to him. He's a man of science and you can barely read!++++@++++Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science.
Why is my swimsuit so revealing?++++@++++Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage.
Where'd you get that rib?++++@++++There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
Learning is cool!++++@++++And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm.
Although I must admit, they know where to stop.++++@++++We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?...
Don't worry. We'll be fine!++++@++++I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!
Oh, I feel full enough as it is.++++@++++I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
Cheer up, my chubby inner child. I've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. Because I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN...++++@++++I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...
Simpson.++++@++++Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself.
Relax, we're just looky-loos. We're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors.++++@++++Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household.
It's so beautiful and modern. Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge...++++@++++A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.
This is the kitchen I've always wanted. Ooh, a bread maker-maker!++++@++++And check this out.
Homie, when I married you, I knew we wouldn't live in luxury.++++@++++And I kept that vow.
But seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.++++@++++I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie.
Oh, Homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor.++++@++++A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!
Maybe you should turn off the power.++++@++++All right.
Don't demolish along the way!++++@++++Fine.
Playdude magazines? Have you been hiding bosom rags from me?++++@++++Trying to.
These magazines are from before we were married. Maybe you should throw them away.++++@++++But I need them for the articles!
I like-a to kiss.++++@++++Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me.
I'm not wearing any clothes. So why don't I just splay myself on a pool table!++++@++++Steady, steady...
Okay, here's your precious articles.++++@++++Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about "Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."
I think you used too much plaster.++++@++++Oh, now you tell me.
I never stopped telling you.++++@++++So that's what that white noise was.
Thanks for taking the job. I'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.++++@++++Get lost, crook!
That's all right, Mrs. Simpson. Many husbands feel emasculated when their wife must turn to a professional to satisfy her remodeling needs.++++@++++Why don't you just kiss her?
What's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?++++@++++How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
Bart, can you come in here for a second?++++@++++Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
It's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!++++@++++Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you.
Oh my God! Someone, somewhere says I'm better than someone else!++++@++++I'm proud of you, honey.
Listen here, Simpson. Your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of John Cheever!++++@++++Adult themes? What are you talking about?
Ralphie wants to go on the pill!++++@++++Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
I can't believe my Mom would cheat.++++@++++Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?
Oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul.++++@++++But she'll still win the contest?
And lose her soul.++++@++++But win the contest?
Blood for creme! Blood for creme!++++@++++Blood for creme! Blood for creme!
Bachelors are always squeezin' stuff!++++@++++Would you excuse us, Milton?
It's Milhouse.++++@++++Yeah, and your father's "No House." Now scram.
I'm just spreadin' the Playdude philosophy. Hi-fi's, Norman Mailer, gettin' some...++++@++++Uh-um... What do you think "some" is?
Uh... toys?++++@++++I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life.
Because we're poor?++++@++++Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
And then the woman...++++@++++Well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough.
Thanks, honey, for saving me from myself.++++@++++And Marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house.
B.F.D. I've had your scrambled eggs, Homer. The secret ingredient is whiskey.++++@++++Hey, it keeps the kids quiet.
Dad, the kids at school said my butt's big.++++@++++That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate.
There's my hundred -- where's my party?++++@++++Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test.
Nope, it's real -- check out the watermark.++++@++++All right.
Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort.++++@++++Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?
See, it's all legit. Now make with the party.++++@++++All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!
People, please. It's a school night.++++@++++I thought you two broke up.
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ...++++@++++Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap.
It's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. They'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.++++@++++So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave.
Next on ABC, who's dropping by to see George Lopez? We pray it's you!++++@++++Open.
I never meant to leave you, Nelson. But uh, something awful happened when I went to the store.++++@++++Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?
I wish it were that simple. I really do.++++@++++They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?
Sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.++++@++++And Lisa, what have you learned?
Nothing. Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight.++++@++++But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?
I guess. But there's a long way to go.++++@++++C'mon, say something conclusive.
I'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.++++@++++Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine.
That was you.++++@++++Prove it.
Perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.++++@++++Woo hoo! Free cheese!
Homer, that was for the dog.++++@++++What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. Then came the heart attacks.
It's a media circus!++++@++++Woo hoo! The circus!
A media circus.++++@++++Woo hoo! I don't know the difference!
I didn't think anyone successful came from Springfield.++++@++++What about that two-headed goat?
Technically he was born in Shelbyville.++++@++++Yes, but he came here to die.
You're successful too, Mom. You made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise.++++@++++Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead.
Mayah Quimby is my er ah, fathah. Give me one million dollahs!++++@++++Huh? Huh?
I remember you from high school. You barfed in my tuba.++++@++++I believe it was the school's tuba.
I got the recipe for these in Istanbul.++++@++++More!
You know, Chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place.++++@++++Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet.
Homer, why do you always have to show that to company?++++@++++It's a conversation starter!
Did you just swallow another bone?++++@++++Same one.
Oh, Mom, don't feel bad. Everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, I'm late for my dinner... with Chloe!++++@++++Good news, Marge!
Chloe has such an amazing life. I wonder what would have happened if I'd stuck with journalism.++++@++++Oh Honey, her life can't compare to yours. You've got three kids, a TV tray from Expo sixty-seven, and you're married to King Stink!
That's a sweet thought, Homie.++++@++++I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know what would be a good name for Maggie? Chloe.
No one's fighting over you!++++@++++Oh. Well then, carry on.
Homer, we've gotta get Lisa!++++@++++All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think about what you did.
I don't see Lisa in any of the seminars!++++@++++And I'm growing ashamed of my penis.
She's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? That's it! She is off the Christmas card list.++++@++++Marge, that's crazy talk. Now look, I'll save Lisa. Your place is here with the women.
We've gotta go now!++++@++++Okay. I'll run as fast as I can, but I'm full of potato salad.
Anybody I know.++++@++++Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too.
Mom, I wanna be just like you. I mean the lava part, not saving Lisa.++++@++++Pretend to care!
...HIND THE 'FRIDGERATOR...++++@++++Whew!
No harm done.++++@++++I wouldn't say that.
I'm not gonna grow up!++++@++++Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle.
I thought it was chocolate milk!++++@++++Yeah, that's how it starts.
Well, I like T-shirts with a nice joke, like "support our troops."++++@++++Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like "Keep On Truckin'". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'.
Ooh!++++@++++You broke in!
We're big fans, Mr. Gladwell.++++@++++Yeah. Nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
And on your way out, remove all the fillings you got under our dental plan.++++@++++You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age.
The Change Magician will change your life... for the better! Results may vary. Machine does not actually sort change. Order today!++++@++++Bart, can I ask you an important question?
How much?++++@++++Twenty-nine ninety-nine.
Here's fifty.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Hey, Homer, how's retirement?++++@++++It's awesome. You know what I've gotten into? Sleeping 'til noon.
Some of us have to get up for work tomorrow.++++@++++Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?
Yeah. Well, enjoy the autumn of your years, jerk.++++@++++Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence.
Your bill, sir.++++@++++No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars.
Dad, the bill's only a hundred.++++@++++I broke some bathroom fixtures.
Pathetic.++++@++++I'm pathetic? Because I take money from my ten-year-old son? Well, let me tell you something: I still call the shots around here!
Homer, use your inside voice.++++@++++I don't have an inside voice!
...or find inclusion in the tribe by caring for vulnerable young cubs.++++@++++Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you.
Great! Will you play Malibu Stacy with me?++++@++++Okay! You be the girl, and I'll be the car.
Done and done. I'm going to the organic market!++++@++++Screw the market, we're going to Mexico!
Wheeee!++++@++++It's El Flanderito! Run him down!
I can't run, I'm wearing flip-flops!++++@++++Hey, what's that dealy?
It shows the history of nuclear physics, from Marie Curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor.++++@++++Oh, you'll win for sure. You and science go together like Lenny and Carl. The science is Carl.
A robot?! Last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. I don't have a chance now.++++@++++Honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. Remember, I did used to work at a science factory.
Well, we're supposed to do this without parental help.++++@++++Sweetie, that's orphan talk.
Did he have a passport?++++@++++Stupid atomic pile. How hard could it be to build a reactor? Korea did it. And look at the quality of their animation.
Hm... what to do, what to do?++++@++++Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement.
Dad?...++++@++++Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!
Dad, what did you do?++++@++++Sweetie, your Daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. You know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?
Yes...++++@++++I juiced it up a little.
Dad, that could explode!++++@++++Oh, that's madiculous.
Homer, I want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!++++@++++I never complain about your frilly pillows.
Goose Gladwell ripped me off and there's nothin' I can do about it. I'm just a stupid kid.++++@++++Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever.
And Homer, I can see you need me more than ever.++++@++++Get back in the garage, old man.
But there's spiders in the boxes.++++@++++Stay out of my boxes!
The things I saw there are what made me crazy.++++@++++Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial...
You can't be serious.++++@++++Are you prepared to take that chance?
Okay, okay. Here's all the money I've got.++++@++++Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat.
Are you sure that thing could really explode?++++@++++Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out.
On the plus side, this rope is mighty soft. Hm, touch it, kids.++++@++++Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
Homer, these are people you work with. Show some restraint.++++@++++Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!
I'm your supervisor!++++@++++Really? How'm I doin'?
Aviation museum audio-visual materials have taken patrons and docents alike on a rocket ride to comprehension. This is the story of those materials.++++@++++Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!
Here we have a vintage film of the original Springfield Wing Walkers, including our own Agnes Skinner.++++@++++Wow, a wooden plane. It's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks.
I flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. Then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. Then the FÃ¼hrer fired me.++++@++++What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.
I've got a bad feeling about all of this.++++@++++C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future.
Is your sense of outrage dulled?++++@++++Spill it, Super-boss!
Now that Mr. Burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases.++++@++++I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on "Friends" need another friend?
That show's gone off the air.++++@++++Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?
You have defeated the doom-bot and sealed the portal. Phobos is safe.++++@++++Phobos? That's a good job for me.
Mine flew away.++++@++++I declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.
I've got the answer!++++@++++Dad?
Now listen. All the drugs we want are right across the border. I have a friend who'll help us.++++@++++The border, eh? Then I'd better sand off my fingerprints.
A-lo-ha!++++@++++Wow, this is just like Hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. What gives?
My Dad, the drug mule.++++@++++Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach.
Oh look, it is Mr. Homer, my favorite customer! Please feel free to paw through my Playdudes and tell me to go back to some country I am not actually from.++++@++++Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?
Help me out, Homer. My little Roddy needs his insulin. Breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing.++++@++++Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday.
I don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...++++@++++Hold on. We're just innocent tourists.
If you let us come, I will give you ten minutes alone with my Squishee machine, do what you will.++++@++++No cameras?
Well where's your super-team now?++++@++++Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!
But the infinite beauty-- / But the Bible says--++++@++++All right, I'm comin' back there.
Today Mounties busted a major American drug smuggling ring. Former U.S. astronaut Homer Simpson was taken into custody.++++@++++My butt looks so huge during perp walks.
Thank God we did not stitch your name over the breast.++++@++++Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you.
I just wish we could make one last big score. But we could never drive past the border patrol.++++@++++There are other ways to get into Canada...
Smuggle drugs in a plane? That'll never work!++++@++++Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!
I've got everything you need.++++@++++Katharine Hepburn?!
Typical Canadian wimpiness. That's why you have snowballs and we have the H bomb.++++@++++We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?
Well, I've always wanted to see a man with the I.Q. of a child executed by the state. We don't get that up here.++++@++++Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.
We're losing altitude. Time to dump all unnecessary weight.++++@++++Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.
It's no use. We've got to make an emergency landing.++++@++++Well, at least we're all in this together.
Now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage.++++@++++See you in Hell, document!
Way to build equity!++++@++++Now remember to eat smart, people. Go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with THAT cheap stuff.
A roll, sir?++++@++++Screw you.
Oatmeal?++++@++++Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!
How rude! What do I have to do to enjoy a Sunday brunch with my secret other family?++++@++++I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!
I wouldn't drink that. From the looks of this place, it might kill you.++++@++++Oh, who are you, the health inspector?
O DANNY BOY, THE PIPES THE PIPES ARE CALLING / FROM GLEN TO GLEN AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE / THE SUMMER'S GONE AND ALL THE ROSES FALLING / 'TIS YOU, 'TIS YOU MUST GO, AND I MUST BIDE.++++@++++Moe's, a tribute. "M" is for Moe, the owner of Moe's. "O" is for the "O" in the middle of Moe's. "E" is for acceptance. The feeling I always got here at Moe's. Oh Moe, don't let 'em close you down!
Hey, a beer's a beer.++++@++++I can't go to a gay bar, I'm too fat! Moe, I'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes.
Mr. Simpson, for a loan this big, you'll have to put up your house as collateral.++++@++++... Marge?
Do whatever you have to do to save Moe's. I love my Homie.++++@++++Okay honey, I'll do it.
Thanks, Homer. No one's ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn't have.++++@++++That was me.
Homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement.++++@++++Marge! How dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
M631700000642J?! This is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?++++@++++I had to! Or Moe's would stay closed forever!
You gave the money to Moe? How's he gonna pay us back?++++@++++Look, look. I can see you're upset. If you need me, I'll be at Moe's.
Well, maybe I'll go to Moe's too, seeing as I'm now part owner.++++@++++Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?
I would like it. You never come to my mother's.++++@++++That's because I hate her.
I'm here protecting our investment. I'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.++++@++++But I don't wanna take care of the kids... Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?
Quit playing dumb.++++@++++How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? Duh, der, duh. That's me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy.
And they seem awfully chummy.++++@++++Just what are you inferring?
I'm not inferring anything. You infer. I imply.++++@++++Whew, that's a relief!
Get lost, rummy!++++@++++Ah yes, Detroit-style. Very nice. So, you've been at Moe's every night this week.
I know, I used to think of Moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. But now that I've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded.++++@++++Bonded?! How many times?
Homer, Moe and I are just work friends. You and I are... marriage friends.++++@++++Thanks, honey. My mind is completely at ease.
Hey, also, I wanna....++++@++++Well, I might as well use this pucker for something.
Howdy, partner! Why don't you sit next to us?++++@++++Hey Moe... haven't seen you in a while.
Uh yeah, how ya doin' there, Homer? Did you ever pass that G.I. Joe you swallowed?++++@++++How do you know about that?
Oh, Marge told me. We share everything.++++@++++You do?
Somethin' wrong, Homer?++++@++++Well... I'm worried about Marge and Moe. They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. But it's not physical. So everything's great, right?
Homer, it's time you learned the sad truth.++++@++++Can I learn it at a happy place?
Although there's no physical intimacy, there's a deep spiritual connection that threatens to destroy your marriage.++++@++++What do I do?
Engage her feelings, become her friend... ooh, get her a Life Magazine from the week she was born. I'll always treasure mine.++++@++++You're absolutely right! Stop this ride!
Oh, I'm too tired to talk.++++@++++Well, I can go all night, baby. I could listen to you two, maybe three, times.
Homie, I'm tired. I have to get up early to catch my flight.++++@++++Catch your flight?
Cuckold! Cuckold! Cuckold!++++@++++What's a cuckold?
Where's Mom going with Uncle Moe?++++@++++He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!
Well, if Hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport.++++@++++I'm off!
Simpson, you were going a hundred in a twenty-five zone. And you're not gonna flirt your way outta this one.++++@++++But I have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
Just say you love me, Marge. Love me like I love you. Please?++++@++++Marge!
Homer! How'd you get in here?++++@++++Toilet hole.
You don't deserve her! You know nothin' about Marge -- what's her favorite food?++++@++++Uh... ice?
He's right.++++@++++Oh, it's true. I don't know Marge at all. I'll just go home now.
Shut it! Shut it!++++@++++Moe, you've won. I'll see you at baggage claim.
Homie...++++@++++Marge, I just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on Moe, here's my card.
Homer, I made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. And besides... I love you. You're my Homie-womie-romie-domie...++++@++++And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
LOVE LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER++++@++++THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER / SOME SWEET TALKING GUY IN A THONG / HANDS YOU A BONG / DON'T TAKE...
YOU'D BETTER STOP++++@++++'CAUSE I WANT A SANDWICH
I SAID STOP++++@++++OR MAYBE A MANWICH...
I used to love Springfield Park, but it's gotten so run down.++++@++++Oh, the prid is gone.
Step right up, and bid on items donated by local businesses!++++@++++Oh, I've only got a hundred dollars. I'd better bid shrewdly.
First up is this video camera.++++@++++One hundred dollars!
Fat wad! I love it!++++@++++Easy... gentle...
Me too. Here's some guy's wallet.++++@++++I'm number one! I beat my son! Victory is mine, so kiss my behind!
Hey Homer, do fries come with that shake?++++@++++Sure do.
Five-time rushing leader, two-time MVP and star of a Disney Channel movie. I played the gentle giant, "Stay-off-drugs-ia".++++@++++I know why you're here. You wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. Well fine.
I wanna buy the rights to that dance for a thousand dollars!++++@++++Woo hoo! But why?
My workman-like touchdowns never make the highlight reel. But if I add your shameless shenanigans, I'll be on ESPN every night!++++@++++You wanna do my dance after you score?
You damn straight. And I'll buy any other dances you got too.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
I'll show myself out.++++@++++"L" is for "loser," which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir.
"The view, sir." Then show ass. Got it.++++@++++Honey, I bet you're wondering why Daddy's not at work again. The answer may surprise you. I have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player.
Looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.++++@++++Don't forget showboating. That's the cornerstone of my "Pyramid of Success."
Homer, this is LeBron James. The fans love my dunks, but they hate my dancin'.++++@++++I think I can fit you in. Let's see...
Homer, you know that's when I play with neighborhood dogs!++++@++++All right, all right, I'll work it out.
But first, the world of sports continues its downward march into the gutter.++++@++++This is either about me, or steroids.
Homer Simpson, we work for the Commissioner of Football. And he wants to see you.++++@++++I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.
Here's why we called you in: we want you to produce this year's Super Bowl halftime show!++++@++++Wow. At last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. You suckers, I would have done it for free!
Fine. Do it for free.++++@++++Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you.
Fine. Pay us.++++@++++Dammit! Will you take a check?
I now pronounce you Pac Man and Wife.++++@++++Every single Super Bowl halftime show has been great.
Oh Homie, don't worry. I'm sure you'll come up with a great idea.++++@++++I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?
We're ready for rehearsal, Mr. Simpson. So, what do we do?++++@++++Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going.
Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message.++++@++++Have you tried checking the oil filter?
Are you even listening to me?!++++@++++Sure, I'd be happy to tell you my problem. I've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with.
Wait a minute -- you've got a medium and I've got a message. Maybe God brought us together for a reason.++++@++++Yeah... you help me, and I, in turn, am helped by you.
Frank went to the men's room. I'm Joe.++++@++++We now take you back through the ages, to a time before TV, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. The time of the Bible!
Not in here, I don't.++++@++++After forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and Noah sent forth a single dove...
You see? You see?++++@++++I thought America was hungry for meaning. I should have just sent a crocodile into space like I originally planned.
That was a good day too.++++@++++Welcome to the "Homer Simpson Showboating Academy."
But I like to stand for good sportsmanship.++++@++++Quiet, you!
And with time running out, the Seminoles are on the warpath!++++@++++Go Seminoles! Cover-the-point-spread! Cover-the-point-spread!
Stay tuned for Sitcom Sunday-++++@++++Where's the remote! This is not a drill, people!
I think he swallowed the remote.++++@++++Barf for your master!
A little more color.++++@++++How do I look?
Dad, can I go to a rap concert? Tickets are fifty dollars.++++@++++Go to Hell.
Okay, what if I pay for it myself?++++@++++Fine, go nuts.
Oh did he? Homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!++++@++++Son, your mother makes a very loud point...
But you said I could go if I paid for the ticket!++++@++++Boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand.
FRESH FR-FR-FRESH FOR MOMMY'S BABY BOY++++@++++BABY BOY, BABY BOY, BA-BA-BA-BABY BOY
Here you go, you little yellow cracker... Now let's go murder our enemies. Peace.++++@++++Bart's gone! I checked everywhere!
That little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!++++@++++If that's true, he's gonna be like NWA -- Not Without Ass-welts.
Well, time to face my punishment like a man... Or, lie my way out of it like a kid.++++@++++A flying rock! Call a geologist!
We have kidnapped your son. Follow instructions and Bart will not be harmed.++++@++++Follow instructions? He's doomed!
Thanksgiving's not for months.++++@++++The bad news keeps on coming.
Do what I say and Bart won't get hurt.++++@++++Oh yeah? Send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
Oh Bart, I'm so glad you're okay.++++@++++Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing I've ever done.
A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...++++@++++...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities.
Dad!? Why did you do that?++++@++++Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true.
Why did you burn up your shirt?++++@++++What shirt? I don't see any shirt.
All right, people, we got a situation here. Your daughter's gonna blow our whole deal sky high.++++@++++You leave Maggie to me.
No, Lisa!++++@++++Not her! She'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
Wait, before we go, I took the liberty of making these embroidered conspiracy jackets for all of us.++++@++++Wow, those jackets are beautiful.
Wait a minute. Why do we have to come clean? Nobody's been hurt. Everyone's happier with the lie.++++@++++The lie is love.
Wait just a minute.++++@++++Love the lie!
That's a very noble sentiment, Lisa. But for once in your life, can't you just be cool?++++@++++Yeah, be cool. Like us.
Dad, I don't understand. After all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?++++@++++Lisa, the world is a very complicated place. And when you get right down to it... cannonball!
I hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.++++@++++Eh, who needs tourists? They never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway.
Lovejoy's an idiot -- his church is giving up hot gobs of gay green. He could get two hundred bucks a couple.++++@++++Two hundred bucks a couple, eh?
You are now an ordained minister.++++@++++Now to answer all the pop-ups. Ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. That's only fair.
I do.++++@++++It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.
Homer, you married every gay couple in town.++++@++++Hey, what can I say? I love love.
Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn.++++@++++Hm... where's Lenny and Carl?
Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.++++@++++But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars.
Well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?++++@++++Opposite? Yuck!!
I mean a man and a woman.++++@++++Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?
Straight.++++@++++Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh.
Reverend Simpson...++++@++++Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness.
I can't. I just can't. Homer, have we started down a slippery slope, where marriage becomes so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?++++@++++Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?
Well, call me old fashioned, but I believe that marriage described in the Bible--++++@++++If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks.
Homer, your impulsive marriages are gonna lead to a lot of divorces.++++@++++Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.
Hey Saturated Fats, I came to ask you a favor.++++@++++Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.
Very funny.++++@++++I wasn't joking.
Oh no. No no. No. I'm just... surprised.++++@++++Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer.
Oh no. Oh no. Why would it be? I love you and I love gay marriage, so I'd be a super-hypocrite if I didn't love your gay marriage. Right?++++@++++Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you.
It smells like cheeseburgers.++++@++++Give it back!
Is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying Aunt Patty? But they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?++++@++++Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.
As opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by.++++@++++Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.
Seriously Dad, I'm worried. You should go on a diet.++++@++++Why you little...
It was so romantic -- like a scene from a Hollywood movie...++++@++++Yeah, "Bride of the Monster."
Marge, if you can find it in your heart to accept me for who I am, I would love to see you at the ceremony. If not, I'll see you at Homer's funeral...which should be pretty soon.++++@++++Got him! Uh-oh.
Selma, we'll always be there for each other. I don't know about Marge, though. If she doesn't show up today...I have no non-identical sister!++++@++++Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so.
I just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married.++++@++++You handsome devil. Someday they'll let you and me get married! Can you imagine the children?
Veronica, in you I have found a soul mate. You are the perfect woman for me: truthful, honest, hiding nothing.++++@++++Next!
At last I have found the yin to my yin.++++@++++If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace.
I knew it! You think everyone in the world should have a big dumb man like you!++++@++++People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here.
Well, I've learned a lesson. Just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'.++++@++++Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge.
Gnoooooo... mes!++++@++++Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base...
I'm down here, you idiot!++++@++++Dad, where's your base?!
Don't worry about that! Someone's gotta greet the customers!++++@++++Eh, they'll be fine.
Son, you are on fire! A million times better than that worthless old coot you replaced.++++@++++That coot happens to be my father. Please continue.
How would you like to be a full-time Sprawl*Mart greeter?++++@++++Is there a chance for advancement?
Yes. The clerk also gave me this bench warrant for Dad's arrest.++++@++++Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?
How am I supposed to know if I'm twenty feet away?++++@++++Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution.
Homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?++++@++++Show you what it's like in the real world!
I like eating here with you, Dad. Especially without "Don't have a cow, man."++++@++++Yeah, he's all "Cowabunga, dude!" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet.
Homer, would you be interested in the position of Executive Greeter?++++@++++Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?
You get to work overtime without us paying you extra.++++@++++I won't do it.
If you don't, we'll ship you right back to Mexico.++++@++++But I'm a U.S. citizen.
Uh-huh. How sure of that are you?++++@++++Dios mio!
It's a chance for you to catch up on all the work I'm assigning you now.++++@++++I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill.
See this? It's the bathroom key. See you in the morning.++++@++++You monster!
We placed a compliance chip in the back of your neck during the company physical.++++@++++That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!
Homer, we took our chips out years ago.++++@++++Really? Then why do you still work here?!
I hope you won't judge us harshly...++++@++++I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
Homer, you forgot to eat your hot dog.++++@++++Mmm, hot dog.
What the hell's menopause?++++@++++Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters.
It's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.++++@++++And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?
Don't cry, sweetie. Everything's gonna be all right.++++@++++Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma.
I'm not dead, idiot.++++@++++I know. That was for the other patients.
Don't give up, Aunt Selma. China has thousands of baby girls who need adoption.++++@++++Great, another job lost to a foreigner.
Wait till the Drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.++++@++++Hey look, a dragon.
Hello, Homer. Give me your peanuts and you can fly on my back.++++@++++I'll give you one.
Oh, you are a very greedy man. The other dragons shall hear of this.++++@++++Hey dragon! You fly like a girl!
Homer, I'm gonna need you to do something for me when we get to China.++++@++++You name it, oh wise mountain ape.
Homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform Selma's life.++++@++++But Marge, I don't want her to be happy.
Okay, don't do it for her--++++@++++Deal.
Do it for me.++++@++++Okay, I'll do it. Because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. Ha-ha, now we're even!
Madam Wu, these are... our children, Bart and Lisa. Yes.++++@++++And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.
Thank you, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different.
These are the famous Shaolin Temple monks. They pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.++++@++++I've heard of these guys. You can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it.
Homer, no stop! You're thinking of Buckingham Palace!++++@++++Wha?
Boys, you see what I was talking about? The greatest things can happen.++++@++++I finally get this play!
So, Mr. Simpson, what do you do for a living?++++@++++I'm a nuclear--
Homer, we need your acrobatic skills. Only you can prevent this riot, and save our beloved Communist dictatorship.++++@++++You guys are commies? Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?
This is Homer, your daddy. Without him, I wouldn't have you.++++@++++Awww. She likes my eyes.
Homer, I do appreciate what you did. How'd you like a little time with "Miss October"?++++@++++I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right.
Homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing Selma's husband was by far the sweetest.++++@++++It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much.
Okay, one quick snuggle.++++@++++Is there any other kind?
They took my baby.++++@++++Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.
Just think about the day you found that Junior Mint in your bellybutton.++++@++++Who told you that?
Madam Wu, we both love the enforcement of pointless rules. But there's a greater joy in bending the rules to help someone who thinks all hope is gone.++++@++++I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours.
You may keep your baby. But you, drop the panda!++++@++++But he loves me.
Feast on my shorts, stupid father man.++++@++++Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough.
Honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. What would the kids and I do if something happened to you?++++@++++Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here.
Homie, if you die, I'm gonna have three kids to take care of. I want you to buy some life insurance. Please?++++@++++Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years.
Mr. Simpson, before we can insure you, we need to ask you some questions. Have you ever had a heart attack?++++@++++Haven't we all?
Strokes?++++@++++None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good.
Are you a smoker?++++@++++Yes I am.
You don't smoke!++++@++++Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
You mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?++++@++++Huh?
Well, I just think we should be building a nest egg.++++@++++Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery.
I have a book from the library with the same information!++++@++++Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
No more directory assistance! It's not free!++++@++++Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient.
Hey, hey, hey. No outside suds!++++@++++I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!
Can you help me unload this soup from the car? There was a sale, so I bought four hundred cans.++++@++++Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far.
Oh Honey, I know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away.++++@++++You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?
Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--++++@++++Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump.
Give us our independence, Homer!++++@++++Yes, President Franklin.
I, uh, was never president. I invented some kind of stove.++++@++++Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew.
Did you spend our savings on a motor home?++++@++++No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!
Well I hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause I'm not speaking to you!++++@++++Dammit!
I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? That's my half-assed Dad!++++@++++Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!
I'll let you sass me!++++@++++I'll let you punch me!
You can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!++++@++++We'll have Christmas tomorrow!
She's a Roam-a-way SilverCoach. Thirty-four feet of walnut-burled freedom.++++@++++Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival.
I've never loved you either. We use jokes to mask our pain at the death of our son. Really.++++@++++Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot.
Can I bring the rest of the convoy?++++@++++Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
Well, we'll give you regional beers.++++@++++It's a deal! Woo hoo!
What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?++++@++++These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
I know another place you can go -- to sleep!++++@++++Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!
You don't belong on the lawn. You belong in your bed with your wife!++++@++++That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
Well, you're not perfect either!++++@++++Name one way I'm not!
No, I don't see Dad doing all that paperwork.++++@++++I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
Oh boy. Let's get out of here before Dad does a bad impression of Mom.++++@++++I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.
And I'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your French fries. It was twenty years ago!++++@++++That was my Woodstock!
You don't take anything seriously. Not even your bankruptcy hearing!++++@++++Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open.
"Dear Mom and Dad: We don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the RV back to the dealer." We've got to stop them.++++@++++Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone.
Oh, I've lost them! I can't see past all the SUVs!++++@++++Don't worry about the SUVs. There's a gentle curve up ahead.
French it up, lover boy!++++@++++I'm not a machine -- I can't just turn it on!
First, raise my allowance.++++@++++Why you little...!
Help us!++++@++++Bring back our children, you Cyprus-splitting jerks!
Just for that, we keep your children.++++@++++Will you raise them Christian?
Coptic Christian.++++@++++Noooo!
Hey, it's only money. And it did make a cool splash.++++@++++Marge, you're taking this pretty well.
Dude, she seemed tense, so we put a little hashish in her meal.++++@++++Cool.
Play?! All plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!++++@++++Look, we'll compromise. We'll go see a play...that Lisa doesn't want to see.
Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!++++@++++Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
Let's see now... barely finished high school, you've challenged me to fight six times since the interview began...++++@++++Make it seven!
"Crack, smack, uppers, downers, outters, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines, LSD mach three, and trace amounts of human urine!"++++@++++There must have been a mistake. My body is a temple.
Guards! Remove this coked-out man balloon from my sight!++++@++++But he misread my pee! He misread my peeeee!
Okay, new meat, you're clean.++++@++++I'm not supposed to be new meat. I'm supposed to have your job.
No Frank Gehry-designed prison can hold me! Ha ha!++++@++++Oh my God! That man might be hurt! Guards, there's a prisoner in there!
Nice nab, Simpson. You did the right thing squealin' on that guy.++++@++++Squealin'? No, I just wanted to help him.
Whatever. How'd you like to be a full-time rat?++++@++++Really? You mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?
Now, now, there are perks. A private cell, extra dessert... and this adorable little hat.++++@++++Well, I am a sucker for a little hat.
So we have an agreement?++++@++++Well... I don't know.
It's the only way you'll survive in here.++++@++++Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch.
Excellent! Now, what have you got for me?++++@++++Homer Simpson has become a snitch.
Your uh, mother.++++@++++Who? Oh, that "my mother." Tell him thanks.
Ooh, a Tiffany's box! And the thing inside is from Tiffany's! Homie, you've never done this before. How'd you afford it?++++@++++Well, if you really must know...
Haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?++++@++++Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off.
The prison snitch is killed! And that could be you! Because you're the prison snitch!++++@++++What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?
Pssst. There's a jailbreak tonight.++++@++++How come nobody told me before?
I sent you an e-vite. You never responded. Nice netiquette, jerk.++++@++++There's gonna be a breakout tonight.
Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!++++@++++Deal!
KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT. KILL THE RAT.++++@++++What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant.
Homer! Homer, where are you?++++@++++Marge! How did you get in here?
Oh, you must be Michael's dad!++++@++++Marge, c'mon!
I want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.++++@++++Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Can I snitch on my heart and say... "I love you"?
Done and done, sir.++++@++++Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!
I'll have you know I buy the finest cuts of beef.++++@++++The guards are sadistic and cruel!
No Dad, you fell asleep in front of the TV watching "The Towering Inferno."++++@++++How do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
Oh it's so great. We can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. I'm so proud of you. Lisa, graduating two years early, and Bart... graduating.++++@++++What'd I miss? What'd I miss?
Homer, we're separated now. You can't just walk in without knocking.++++@++++Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules.
She's really enjoying Alaska.++++@++++Stupid wildlife, serves 'em right.
When I was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.++++@++++Oh, Marge...
All right! You guys are my new best friends.++++@++++You wish, loser!
Watch it with the attitude, Mister. You came from my back fat!++++@++++Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z.
Oh please, not this again.++++@++++Son, say hello to Edna.
Actually, Homer, I'm... into your lady.++++@++++Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!
You mean get beaten up by him?++++@++++Exactly.
And I'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea.++++@++++You don't know the half of it.
Homer, do something about this leak!++++@++++Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!
That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!++++@++++Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!
FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...++++@++++Aw, guys. This is just what I needed.
This ain't for you, sweat stain. It's a surprise party for Lenny, thrown by his closest friends.++++@++++So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?
I live here now. You're looking at the new owner of the Little Caesar's down the street. Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. Sorry. That button sticks.++++@++++So why didn't you invite me?
We couldn't tell you ahead of time, because you'd spill the beans.++++@++++I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.
Six years' planning down the drain!++++@++++I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
Oh great, Homer! I bake a cake shaped like Lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it.++++@++++Well, I can see I'm not wanted here.
Read the sign, pre-vert.++++@++++I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
I got my own problems. I just lost this eye last night.++++@++++How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world.
I haven't seen this much melted cheese since I left my Billy Joel albums out in the sun.++++@++++The sun.
Hey, you wanna split this?++++@++++Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am.
Hey, my name's Ray -- Ray Magini.++++@++++Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?
Beats me -- I'm no marriage counselor. Just a licensed and bonded roofer.++++@++++Ray, will you help me fix my roof?
Sure, I'll help ya, under one condition -- you gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer.++++@++++Wait, did I add that right?
Now, for my first act as President...++++@++++To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.
DO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME / ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH / WITH A MAN LIKE YOU...++++@++++Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.
Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.++++@++++I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.
It means you have to fix the roof!++++@++++Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where.
Knockers on route 98.++++@++++How did you know?
I'm psychic. Look, I don't know if I want a roofer who hangs out in bars.++++@++++You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats.
Eh, I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets.++++@++++Ray would high-five me.
That's what I like about you, Homer. Everything impresses you.++++@++++Impresses. What a big word! I'm gonna look that up.
Ah, this is gonna take some work. Tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house?++++@++++I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.
No problem. Accidents happen.++++@++++One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war!
Hey Homer!++++@++++Ned, are you okay?
Oh sorry man, I gotta go. This says my kid attempted something. I hate the way these things cut off.++++@++++Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again!
And why is the hole in the roof even bigger?++++@++++Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.
It's after six -- he's not coming back. He's a lousy roofer and a flake!++++@++++My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches...
I don't want to hear any more about Ray. Tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.++++@++++Ray's not gonna like that.
You're not married to Ray!++++@++++Well if I was, we'd have taller kids!
Hey Homer! Look, I just came down with a case of shingles.++++@++++What's in the box?
Hey, I'm real sorry I never made it back yesterday. I hope we're still friends?++++@++++Of course we are! If you wanna be.
What are you doing? Why aren't you fixing the roof?++++@++++I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.
I'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray! Who, by the way, I've never even met!++++@++++All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him.
Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that?++++@++++Something like that.
Homer, come down for dinner.++++@++++Did you make enough for Ray?
Ray's not coming!++++@++++He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.
Homer, I know where Ray is.++++@++++Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me!
Sweetheart, your friend Ray is in your head.++++@++++Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist.++++@++++Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!
Excuse us for a moment.++++@++++What am I doing here? Let me go!
We'll let you go when you admit there is no Ray Magini.++++@++++Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!
Homer, no one has ever seen Ray but you.++++@++++But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn.
I saw you talking to yourself.++++@++++Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!
Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him.++++@++++Ned, are you okay?
And here's the clincher... Ray Magini is an anagram for "imaginary."++++@++++Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and...
Actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy.++++@++++Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!
When you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life.++++@++++Aw, what did he die of?
Homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat--++++@++++Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.
That was rubber covered in Vaseline!++++@++++Marge, write that down so we can have it at home.
Do you see anyone here who isn't here?++++@++++Nope, just you, Marge and Yogi Bear. Kidding!
Oh sorry, Homer. But recent historical evidence indicates that Robin Hood did not actually exist.++++@++++Fascinating!
Hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence!++++@++++The awesome power of the human mind.
Check and mate.++++@++++So, Ray does exist?!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all crooks. It's true.++++@++++Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big!
Well, Homer, I could make it up to you... maybe a free eye-scraping.++++@++++That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else.
Homer, can I please knock off? I've got surgery in the morning.++++@++++Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't.
So as I was saying, Homer, Mondays, nine o'clock, CBS. They say everybody loves that guy, but I don't get it.++++@++++What are you talking about?
Hey, I'm just sayin', catch it while you still can.++++@++++What time's the show on?
It's Monday, nine o'clock, CBS.++++@++++And what's the network?
CBS.++++@++++At what time?
Nine o'clock.++++@++++And if I wanna watch it, what day?
Monday. Monday, nine o'clock.++++@++++And this is on the radio?
No, television. Mondays at nine. On CBS.++++@++++And if I wanna see it, what time should I watch it?
Monday.++++@++++On the radio?
Television.++++@++++Turn the television to what channel?
Nine o'clock on Monday.++++@++++Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?
It's only on on Monday.++++@++++And what time? Would be a good time to see it?
Nine o'clock. It's from nine to nine thirty.++++@++++So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
Not the radio, television.++++@++++So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC.
Oh, so I've been replaced by a machine?++++@++++Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?
My heart! It hurts so much! Like it's caught in a vice!++++@++++Aw, my little boy's in love.
I think he's having a heart attack!++++@++++C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!
It's graffiti you can eatie!++++@++++You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the "library."
Where are you really going?++++@++++Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window.
I'd better tell Dad.++++@++++Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry.
Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?++++@++++Overeating. And if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. But there won't be time.
Even on the nose hurts!++++@++++Wow, he's just the kind of weirdo Bart needs.
Tough love? Of course, this has never made sense! The sign shop guy lied. Stanley! You didn't question the word "luck?" Now look what we've got. Thanks for the correction, that's part of the honesty.++++@++++Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!
I already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner.++++@++++So that's where my soot went!
This fat camp can save Bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. Homer, maybe you could ask Mr. Burns for a raise.++++@++++Even better, I'll ask him for my job back.
I know how we can raise money!++++@++++Youth? I hate them. Secondly...
How much is costed for stay-night-of-one?++++@++++How much is got, Wolfgang Schmuck?
Let's see here. I can offer you uh, fifty dollars a week.++++@++++Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
Here's your tip, Baldylocks. If you want it, dance and sing.++++@++++NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS / AUF IHREM WEG ZUM HORIZONT / HIELT MAN FUER UFOS AUS DEM ALL / DARUM SCHICKTE EIN GENERAL /
They want a second verse. I hope he knows it.++++@++++EINE FLIEGERSTAFFEL HINTERHER / ALARM ZU GEBEN, WENN ES SO WAR / DABEI WAR DA AM HORIZONT / NUR NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS
Not for long -- I'm saying goodbye to Scammer and Z-Dog. I've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.++++@++++Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?
When I raged against the machine, money poured out.++++@++++Oh boy.
Uh, please to have new facecloth. Schnell.++++@++++Time to take out the Euro-trash.
To Disneyland! Where we will heap the scorn on Goofy!++++@++++Now, everything's perfect again.
Folks, you have three weeks left on a non-refundable weight-loss treatment. So if anybody else in the family wants to use it, use it now.++++@++++But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?
PSI -- Poor Self Esteem. It's not "I." Every sign is wrong!++++@++++Oh, that's terrible.
We got a long drive ahead. You wanna pull off into a motel? We'll split a room.++++@++++Where will I sleep?
What are you eating now?!++++@++++Cheeseburger.
You're a catastrophe. Lemme have half of it.++++@++++I don't wanna.
I just want the cheese, I don't want the meat. I do want the meat.++++@++++Here's a corner.
I mean, just bite it, don't rip it. Lemme have the whole thing. You'll get some later.++++@++++You're a selfish jerk.
I smelled it, it has to be eaten.++++@++++But it's my burger.
I'm driving. I'll kill us.++++@++++Fine. I'd rather die.
Call the police.++++@++++I need change for a dollar.
No change without purchase.++++@++++What's the cheapest thing you've got?
A two ounce bag of chips. Five ninety-nine.++++@++++Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!
Maybe we could shop somewhere else. There's a farm stand next door.++++@++++Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.
It's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces.++++@++++I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.
Stop it! You'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. Now, close your eyes...++++@++++Where's my bucket?!
AND IF THAT DIAMOND RING TURNS BRASS / MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A LOOKING GLASS++++@++++Lisa sings so sweetly and Bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
Lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!++++@++++And she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord!
Why? Just because she sings like Whitney Houston brought to life?++++@++++Don't lose hope, sweetie. I'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. And that's not just the beer talking. Your father's in here too.
Questioning the kid's sexuality -- well done.++++@++++Here you go, honey. Sing this.
How did you write a song so quickly?++++@++++Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!
Ah, what do you jerks know? That's a quality joke.++++@++++You did it, sweetie!
I really do like working with you, Dad. Will you keep helping me?++++@++++Of course, Sweetie. You and I are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken Hellhole.
But your song said you liked Springfield.++++@++++I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names.
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LAAAAAAA.++++@++++Good job, sweetie. Every time you hit that note, I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun.
I really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, Dad.++++@++++Honey, our time together is precious to me. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't think I'm gonna be around much longer.
Really? What's wrong?++++@++++Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win.
Sorry, sweetie. We don't have green.++++@++++Let Daddy go talk to the man.
That's Cameron. Girls go crazy over him. He's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life.++++@++++Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make "Moon River" sound like a farting Orangutan.
Sweetie, tonight you were perfect...++++@++++Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. Now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect.
Mr. Simpson, I brought those Twizzlers you asked for.++++@++++My little girl likes Red Vines! You little...
He's crazy!++++@++++Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy.
Yeah. For once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? Would that be so hard?++++@++++Hey, gimme a break. Living through Lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me.
But Dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people.++++@++++You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
I don't like sausage.++++@++++Then would you like to see it getting made?
Dad... you're fired.++++@++++Fired... me?
Dad, I'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. You were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business.++++@++++Do you know the hours I worked? The people I had to yell at? The tires I had to slash?
No one asked you to yell and slash!++++@++++It's called smoozing!
Hell, I'll even go shoe shopping.++++@++++Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!
You're working with Cameron now?++++@++++His name isn't Cameron anymore. He's now "Johnny Rainbow."
Mr. Simpson, about that...++++@++++I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.
So, are you a Colonel or a Captain?++++@++++Neither. I'm both.
Actually, I think your father's still upset about the way things went down.++++@++++Marge. Bart. Maggie. Santa's Little Helper. Lisa!
Dad, I don't want things to be awful between us. I made you some cookies.++++@++++I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
Uh, sorry hon, this is all we got. Who's next?++++@++++We are!
Sure. Sure thing, Mr. S.!++++@++++Lisa.
Dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. I don't care if I win, just as long as you're in my corner again.++++@++++I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business.
Dad, you sabotaged Cameron for me!++++@++++Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy.
Well, I think you're the sweetest Dad in the whole world.++++@++++I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.
Now you're getting creepy.++++@++++How 'bout "I love you, honey?"
Oh. I see. Well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause I'm not driving you.++++@++++Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!
Leave your body, Seymour. Leave your body.++++@++++"Left Below." Ooh, a "He Is Risen" production!
Church? I'd rather play golf on the holiest day of the week.++++@++++Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him.
It's the Rapture, Shawna. The Rapture. The virtuous have gone to heaven, and the rest of us have been... left below!++++@++++Left below?! Where have I heard that before?
It's the title of the movie.++++@++++It's everywhere!
Why did I choose to be gay?++++@++++This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two.
Sweetie, don't worry. God wouldn't spring the Rapture on us unannounced. He'd send us signs, like, I don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving.++++@++++Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little "rapture" for Mama?
Ooh, I could be the Rachel to your Jacob.++++@++++Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship.
You too.++++@++++Blood is raining from the sky!
Can I help you? We're having a sale on Bible magnifying glasses.++++@++++Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?
Yes, this one is fifteen per cent off.++++@++++I'll take everything you've got!
And would you like to take advantage of our "Friends of Flanders" discount?++++@++++No, thank you.
Homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. And you're reading books! Word books! What's going on?++++@++++Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh.
Three million, one hundred and--++++@++++Up bup bup!
May eighteenth? That's one week from today!++++@++++A week? That's...seven days from now!
This is Kent Brockman reporting live from downtown Springfield, where overweight doomsayer Homer Simpson is predicting the world will end... next Wednesday! Homer, what turned you from sad drunk to mad monk?++++@++++Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!
That must mean you're right about the Rapture too.++++@++++Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted.
I see. Well, we have thirty seconds left -- any other cuckoo yip yap?++++@++++Uhhh...
Homer, I'm glad you're getting exercise, I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise.++++@++++Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane.
Dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. Yet. A hundred years, global warming... we're goners. But for now, do you think you could lighten up on this "left below" stuff?++++@++++Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.
'Cause that girl's school says I can't do that no more.++++@++++When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here.
That's Springfield Mesa! It's fifteen miles north, past the Warren Harding Memorial Through-hole!++++@++++Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache.
Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-Rapture party.++++@++++No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested.
Dad, please don't go through with this. All through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong.++++@++++But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this.
Lisa's going! We're all going!++++@++++C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below.
Wait for me! I'm a-comin'!++++@++++Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!
Two... one...++++@++++Goodbye, stupid Earth!
There appears to be some delay!++++@++++Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
Homie... I'd better start dinner.++++@++++Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?
Dad, if you'll recall, I never believed in you, not for one second.++++@++++Aw, that's my girl.
Hey, Fatwad! Here's another thing you didn't predict.++++@++++Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.
Yeah, school.++++@++++Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!
We're not going anywhere, except to bed!++++@++++But my prediction says--
Homer Simpson! Welcome to Heaven. Now let's get you some clothes, huh?++++@++++I'm comfortable like this.
This is our nature walk... our pedicure hut... our state-of-the-art showroom, tonight featuring Los Lobos. And over there is our water slide, that's coming next year. It's gonna be super fantastic.++++@++++How come it's not open yet?
And the best part of Heaven is, anything you wish for, you get... lickity split!++++@++++Hm...
So if you need further assistance, just call the front desk and ask for Andre, okay?++++@++++Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash.
You know you could wish for some.++++@++++I could.
Oh, don't tell me about family suffering. My Son went down to Earth once. I don't know what you people did to Him, but He hasn't been the same since.++++@++++Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--
Pass.++++@++++Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy.
Hey, what's the big idea, pally? Why so crabby?++++@++++Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!
Squandered my gift? I made sixty-eight albums.++++@++++I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.
What do you want, Homer?++++@++++Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so.
But it's already started. To do what you're asking, I'd have to turn back time.++++@++++Superman did it.
You want me to help you with your alcoholism?++++@++++No, I'm in a good place with that.
Why don't you just take these pamphlets?++++@++++Yeah, I'll definitely read those later.
The Warren Harding Through-hole never seemed so long.++++@++++Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me...
Humorist David Sedaris takes a wry look at overcrowding in America's prisons.++++@++++Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!
Hey, I won four free movie tickets! And it starts in half an hour!++++@++++Free movie tickets?! I feel like Roger Ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!
A TV shark is not a babysitter!++++@++++How about this guy?
Howdy, Homer. You here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?++++@++++Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later.
Oh, sorry, but I promised to rewind videotapes for the poor.++++@++++Come on Flanders, doesn't that "Bible" of yours say to "love thy neighbor"? Why won't you love me?
All right, neighbor, I'll baby-sit.++++@++++Thanks, Ned.
Yeah, so I can't see my own shrinky dink.++++@++++Makes sense.
Honey, you can be anything you want to be.++++@++++This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!
Would you care for a segment?++++@++++Yes.
Mom, I don't wanna read -- it's the weekend!++++@++++I've had enough -- I'm leaving!
He doesn't even know what's going on!++++@++++Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.
And you say Mr. Flanders remains completely ignorant of their dot-kama sutra?++++@++++Yep, and nobody's tellin' him. Not even his good buddy God.
Boy, nothin' is sexier than still photos in a girlie magazine. wha?++++@++++Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders.
What are you two doing?++++@++++Uh, we're watching the latest photos from Mars. Ho, great stuff. Worth every billion.
It's happening in Ned's house! Why would he allow that?++++@++++Well that's obvious. He doesn't even know.
C'mon. You tell him right now. Ned, Homer has something to tell you.++++@++++Uh, I'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. It's called "Plops" and...
You know what I mean.++++@++++Okay. Flanders, you see...
Homer, is this true?++++@++++Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!
The Bible says "cast your bread upon the waters." But all I got was a bunch of soggy bread.++++@++++Mmm... soggy br--
Don't say it, Homer. This is not the time.++++@++++...ead.
Dad, I don't think you realize what you've done. You've totally humiliated the best friend the Simpsons ever had.++++@++++You're right. But you know who the real victim is here? Ned.
That's what we've been trying to tell you!++++@++++Oh yeah.
The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.++++@++++Last-diddily-ast? He's gone! And it's all someone's fault!
Well, Homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. But at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. I've taken every precaution.
Damn straight. Clay Roberts. I coach wrestling, so everyone calls me coach.++++@++++Um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, I want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all...
That's coming from next door!++++@++++Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called "who can punch the softest?" And he always lets me win!
Encourage me!++++@++++Lookin' good... feel the burn...
Louder!++++@++++You're a god!... I can't think of any more!
Just say "Go! Go! Go"!++++@++++Go! Go! Go!
Chop Shop! Chop Shop!++++@++++Hey, you knocked out my power. How am I supposed to eat without watching TV?
Yeah, something tells me you won't starve. Huh? Huh Chief? Huh?++++@++++When are you gonna stop poking me? Will it be soon?
Relax, dumbass. Oh, by the way -- I borrowed some gas from your car. You dumbass.++++@++++But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...
Huh? What are you doing? Reminiscing... like a woman?++++@++++Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
Homer? What are you doing here?++++@++++Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield.
Why? So you can make me a laughingstock again?++++@++++After the party.
Well, that is true. In fact--++++@++++Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit...
Really? Well that's too bad, 'cause I'm not leaving. See, I like this place, and I've already got Fatso here broken in. Ain't that right, Fatso?++++@++++I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.
Why'd you do that? I was beggin' for mercy.++++@++++I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.
Did you steal the organ from the church?!++++@++++Maybe. We don't know that for sure.
It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?++++@++++Go nuts.
Bart, I love you. But sometimes I don't love your choices. Now we have to find another school for you.++++@++++And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge.
Think of the leg up you'd have!++++@++++How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?
I need two double A batteries. Now!++++@++++Get 'em from the smoke detector.
What if there's a fire?++++@++++The smoke will wake us up.
Catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.++++@++++Catholic school, eh...?
My pacemaker!++++@++++Classic Grampa.
Don't you touch bead one! Homer, maybe we should be concerned. Catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on Friday...++++@++++No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?
Yes'm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto...++++@++++Bart! What the Hell are you saying?
That's Latin, Dad. The language of Plutarch.++++@++++Mickey Mouse's dog?
No, Plutarch. He chronicled the lives of the Roman emperors.++++@++++Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?
We're having our monthly pancake dinner. Care to join us?++++@++++You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
Â¡Que buenos cake-os de pan-o!++++@++++All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son.
I understand. But can it wait 'til after Bingo?++++@++++Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
Bingo.++++@++++That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
How 'bout you just say "Yay, I won."++++@++++Bingo!
I've never seen such masterful bingo playing. What's your secret, Homer?++++@++++You have to cheat.
I'll admit the vow of celibacy is one of our sterner challenges.++++@++++Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video.
Well that's true, but if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession.++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?
If you truly repent, then yes.++++@++++Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn...
Um, not quite, Mr. Simpson. I can only absolve you if you're a Catholic.++++@++++Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
...but it ends with bread and wine.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Homer, you've been out all night! And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. Were you at that Catholic Church?!++++@++++Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!
I knew they'd try to convert you! That's what they do! Well I'm not having another twelve kids.++++@++++Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See...
Forget it! And you know, I went to a Catholic wedding once. The incense ruined my pantsuit!++++@++++Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion.
where's Homer and Bart?++++@++++Wow! Up here, that feels good!
Yes, Homer?++++@++++Transubstantiation!
Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. Like the Jews with their snippity-snip.++++@++++Marge, what are you doing here?
It wasn't a fair fight! Your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax.++++@++++Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!
Well, I'm gonna show Bart that Protestants can be hip too. How do you like those croutons?++++@++++Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you.++++@++++Bwa?
My hive! My trademark hive!++++@++++Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt.
We got a real nail-biter here at Mile-High Stadium, the Broncos down by one, and thirty seconds left on the clock.++++@++++C'mon Broncos... you can do it...
Oh looky there, Denver just won the ballgame...++++@++++The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?
Who's Professor Pigskin?++++@++++He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
How is that possible?++++@++++Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
I get it. Every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think Professor Pigskin is always right! That's when they ask for your money.++++@++++I have money!
Dad, it's a scam!++++@++++A scam? Not according to "Eddie F. from Tucson," or "Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan."
Look, all I'm saying is, you really should think twice before...++++@++++...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
Dad, how much money did you bet?++++@++++Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him.
If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.++++@++++But the pig!
Yeah. It's called "Lemony Lick-It: A Series Of Horny Events".++++@++++Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week.
Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village. I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars...++++@++++Thanks, Moe!
I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a PlayStation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.++++@++++It got your hopes up, didn't it?
Homer, before I take the kids, I want you to swear you're not up to something.++++@++++I swear.
And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.++++@++++Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.
What is this, a reunion of "Fahrenheit 9 on 1?"++++@++++Guys, get out of here!
Homer, how'd you ever get Marge to go along with this?++++@++++Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie.
Is this a snuggle film?!++++@++++Um... you're in the wrong house, lady.
How could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!++++@++++Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say.
Away from you.++++@++++When will you be back?
You are.++++@++++Me? But I'm the father.
Boy, Homer. I've never seen Mom this mad.++++@++++Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!
Bye Bart! I love you, Lisa! Sleep tight, Maggie! Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!++++@++++Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt.
She should be back now. It's dinner time.++++@++++Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles.
All we've got is ketchup.++++@++++You mean "Homer's famous marinara sauce."
No. I mean ketchup.++++@++++Where's your sense of magic and wonder?
You told me to call. You wanted to see if your phone was workin'.++++@++++Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?
Well ain't you got call waitin'?++++@++++Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!
Good girl. Yes, yes. This animal means you no harm. She's a sweet old Florida manatee. Also known as a sea cow or a dugong.++++@++++Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
And treated like I deserve.++++@++++It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.
Oh yes, seÃ±ora left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.++++@++++Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?
Ew.++++@++++Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them.
Country cousins? Are they rubes? 'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.++++@++++Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!
Can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?++++@++++We'll say it's all our birthdays!
We're having lasagna and Caesar salad.++++@++++Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.
So, Homer, how are you?++++@++++Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better.
And how is our lovely Marge?++++@++++She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner.
Oh, why that's terrible!++++@++++It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned.
What am I supposed to do, bury them at Arlington?++++@++++Marge?
Ooo.++++@++++Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry.
Homie, I accept your apology.++++@++++I love you, Marge.
But I'm not coming back yet.++++@++++Wha...?!
I've found a place where I'm needed.++++@++++You're needed at home!
I'm sorry, Homie. I just can't find it in my heart to come back right now.++++@++++Well, that's very reasonable.
Something a strong, passionate woman like her needs: a purpose.++++@++++Wow. I can see why she loves you.
She doesn't love me. She's just trying to find herself.++++@++++You know everything.
I don't know everything. I'm just a man.++++@++++And what a man!
Saving!++++@++++Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.
Aw man, I just wish we could see their tears.++++@++++Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
In fact, they're bigger than us.++++@++++Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!
You're a brave man. And we respect two things: bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. Let's go.++++@++++Rubes.
Homer, are you okay? How many fingers am I holding up?++++@++++Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.
Oh, my sweet, sweet Homie! You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.++++@++++Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes...
I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband.++++@++++Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.
And I always will.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Don't you have to be back at work?++++@++++Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.
It's seven a.m. What are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?++++@++++Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee.
Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast.++++@++++Stupid best friend Flanders.
A stamp museum?++++@++++Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!
Well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. What ever happened to "please" and "thank you"?++++@++++I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals.
We have to stop all this construction. The noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the Jell-o.++++@++++What man would want this now?!
Instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!++++@++++Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking.
Oh sure you can, sweetie. Just don't make a habit of it.++++@++++Okay, just let me clear some space.
So that's why I've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.++++@++++Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning.
Oh, wait a minute. There's no batteries in this thing.++++@++++I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter.
Tonight I want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... Homer, stop that!++++@++++There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.
Homer, can you help me out here?++++@++++Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you.
Dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house.++++@++++Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart.
Hey, Simpsons! That'll be forty bucks!++++@++++I thought it was twenty.
Yeah, that's per axle. Park over there in Carl Four. No early outs!++++@++++I can't believe you're making money off this!
You guys need water?++++@++++No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
Thanks to me, Katherine Blodgett, we have non-reflecting glass.++++@++++Butter face.
And I'm jumbo shrimp! Maximum two servings!++++@++++That's bull man.
I don't care what Apu was in a past life. In this life, he's a blabbermouth!++++@++++Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... "Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..." blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
I didn't know grownups said bad things about other grownups.++++@++++Lisa!
I know. I'm sorry.++++@++++Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run.
Is it the chair?++++@++++Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?
Grampa?++++@++++Tragically, yes.
What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? Hm?++++@++++Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up.
Well, I hope he's accompanied by the "How was your day" monster, and the "Foot rub" monster and the let me just...++++@++++Don't worry, he's not showin' up.
All I see is an empty grave. Why don't you fill it, ya lazy bastard?++++@++++Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house.
What about Bart's bedroom?++++@++++You know that racecar bed I made him?
Did you bring those home movies of your daughter I asked for?++++@++++Uh... this is all I could find.
Who was filming that scene?++++@++++Stationary camera.
Four thousand dollars?!++++@++++Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake...
I'm not chasing you, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
New pony?++++@++++Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
That's not what you do with a hymnal. Homer!++++@++++I forgot to floss this morning!
Heal my scabs, Lord!++++@++++Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep.
Oh, sugar-booger!++++@++++Aw, poor Maggie.
Homer, don't touch her! You've never had chicken pox.++++@++++I know, and you did, and you're great.
Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! It could leave you sterile down there.++++@++++Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?
I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.++++@++++Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!
Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?++++@++++I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox.
Really? Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd? Then there'll be a pox on both our houses!++++@++++Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?
Au contraire, man with no hair! You see, Rod and Todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!++++@++++So you want Maggie to infect your kids?
You betcha! In fact, some parents have been known to hold "pox parties," so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please.++++@++++And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
Well, they might. But you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors...++++@++++...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
...normally I'm not one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage, but, you shoulda seen it... oh, there he is.++++@++++Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!
I never drank one of these without a cigarette in it!++++@++++Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!
Almost anyone's got a chance now.++++@++++Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!
All right, we get it!++++@++++Marge, what's happening to me?
Oh Homie, you got chicken pox. But how?++++@++++I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
You sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! Homer!++++@++++Mmm... Homer-oats.
Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten!++++@++++Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying.
I have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband!++++@++++Okey-doke. And you are...
The wife of your wife's lover!++++@++++Will she know what this is regarding?
You moron! Marge is having an affair with Kirk!++++@++++That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff.
Never mind about those two. Just answer me one question. How did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed?++++@++++This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!
Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!++++@++++Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?
How could you ask me that?++++@++++I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?
Homer, you're crazy!++++@++++You're not saying no.
Fine... No!++++@++++I'm still not hearing no.
No, no, no!++++@++++Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!
Get out of this house!++++@++++Gladly.
Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house.++++@++++I came to get my mail.
Lisa, we don't need to know how. It's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war.++++@++++Well, I'd better go.
Where are you staying?++++@++++You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park.
So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize.++++@++++Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad.
Where's my apology?++++@++++Where's my bucket?
This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed!++++@++++Why you little...
Just do it! Trust me!++++@++++Okay.
Mom... Dad. I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.++++@++++Make it two kajillion.
Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all.++++@++++Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
I'm afraid your son is in a deep, deep coma from which he will never emerge.++++@++++I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
A robot?++++@++++Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. "This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..." Kaboom!
Time to destroy the one who did this to me.++++@++++Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could...
Sure. Let him have it.++++@++++Why you metal...!
David is so helpful...++++@++++And he's great with the neighbors.
More waffles, Father?++++@++++Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!
Did you replace me with this tinkertoy?++++@++++Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
I will comply.++++@++++Here, make me a kitty!
I hate going to the zoo. I feel so sorry for the animals.++++@++++Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream.
We're still going to the toy store, right? And I can pick out as many toys as I want?++++@++++No toys!
You told me he was at culinary school!++++@++++You wanted to believe the lie!
To get me, you'll have to go through your fa...++++@++++Those were my good pants.
Well, the important thing is we're a family again.++++@++++This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
I'll call work and tell them he can't make it.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Please don't accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel.++++@++++Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus.
And there's bananas in that tree up there.++++@++++They look a little green.
You can't escape me, Simpson -- you're not smart enough!++++@++++Yes I am! I mean...
Done and done!++++@++++Marge! You saved me.
Staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.++++@++++Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions.
I'm turning you into your costumes!++++@++++Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?
Oh, this isn't fair. I wasn't wearing a costume.++++@++++Marge isn't home.
But what will junkies do drugs under?++++@++++They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people.
Whoa, Sir, we're dismantling this ride. It's not safe.++++@++++I call the red one!
Robusto is not for sale! But would you like to buy my last dumbbell?++++@++++Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.
Homie, if I buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?++++@++++Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight...
Our tandem bicycle! When I bought it, you said you'd ride with me.++++@++++But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show!
I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?++++@++++Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!
Awww. I'll be right down.++++@++++Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message!
Don't do that... that hurts. Careful, careful.++++@++++Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?
Homer, how'd your right arm get so strong?++++@++++Just liftin' this dumbbell.
Stop the showcase!++++@++++I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn.
Oh no you don't! I just got an idea.++++@++++Wha? Hey, you...
I got a new liver, and I'm breakin' it in.++++@++++Excuse me, Mr. Bartender sir, may I have a sugar-free ginger ale? And uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds.
Where are you two going?++++@++++I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
Uh-huh. And how will this affect your job at the power plant?++++@++++Negatively, I assume.
Oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. Have fun!++++@++++Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!
Forget about it, Homer. She's dead to you now.++++@++++Okay.
Oh, Marge called you. She said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin.++++@++++Did she say anything else?
Yeah. She said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to Moe.++++@++++Oh Marge, I love her so much.
Now Homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? Your first opponent is Lefty "The Righty" Leftwright.++++@++++He looks tough.
Yeah, he only lost once: in his fight against illiteracy.++++@++++I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.
C'mon, Homer! We can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the Eastern Division, Class B, over thirty-five, Amateur Grouping!++++@++++Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife.
SWEET HOME ALABAMA / WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE++++@++++SWEET HOME ALABAMA...
I thought it was arm wrestling.++++@++++I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.
OOH, MY LITTLE PRETTY ONE, MY PRETTY ONE / WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE ME SOME TIME, SHARONA / OOH, YOU MAKE MY MOTOR RUN, MY MOTOR RUN / GOT IT COMIN' OFF O' THE LINE, SHARONA / NEVER GONNA STOP, GIVE IT UP, SUCH A DIRTY MIND / I ALWAYS GET IT UP FOR THE TOUCH OF THE YOUNGER KIND / MY, MY, MY, AYE-AYE, WHOA! /++++@++++That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!
Mid-June?++++@++++Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve.
Hey Simpson, are you gonna steal the sign?++++@++++JOY TO THE WORLD, A FATHER'S BORN / LET ME RECEIVE GREAT GIFTS!
Dad, there's no such thing as "Father's Day Eve."++++@++++No Father's Day Eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... Daddy Claus?
Fine, there's a Daddy Claus.++++@++++Is there a Super Bowl Bunny?
Bart... Lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.++++@++++Oh, can I come with you? I know I can't.
Here you go, Dad. I hope you like it. I've forgotten what it is.++++@++++A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.
Oh Captain, you're so handy!++++@++++Bart, this is the greatest present I ever received. To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson. Whatchu got, Lisa?
What do you think? Huh? Huh? Pretty heartfelt, huh? Huh?++++@++++Oh, it's heartfelt. There's no escaping that. Thanks, honey.
You didn't like it, did you?++++@++++No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now.
Oh Dad, how could you?++++@++++It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.
She's not going to get over this quickly -- I know women.++++@++++Yeah, but I know how to win women back. I even won you back after I lost our wedding album in a bar bet.
I'm not a baby! A baby is zero to two.++++@++++Her first words! Play along. It's fifty cents less for babies!
I'd rather not go than lie.++++@++++How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?
Your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a Thermos-brand thermos onto the street!++++@++++Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
I'm afraid Lisa's rage stems from extraordinary disillusionment with a parental figure. In this case, her father.++++@++++Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up.
Mr. Simpson, Lisa is at a crucial juncture. If she doesn't see her father as a positive role model, she could hate men for the rest of her life.++++@++++Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?
The school is looking for a new "Safety Salamander". When Lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender.++++@++++I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?
Uh... he fell asleep in the suit and suffocated.++++@++++I can do that!
School buses don't have seat belts.++++@++++Then what protects you if we crash?
A metal bar at tooth level.++++@++++Stop this bus!
Are you a girl? 'Cause I don't see a sala-wiener.++++@++++Did I hear "where are the fireworks?" 'Cause heeere they are!
Ahhhh!++++@++++Every man for himself! Trample if you must!
Janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. Couldn't you be that kind of dad?++++@++++Now honey, you know Daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore.
Springfield needs a hero and it needs one now!++++@++++This looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
My mother's still in the car.++++@++++No, she's not.
Three cheers for our new hero!++++@++++Only three?
Okay, six!++++@++++That's more like it!
Hip, hip hurray! Hip, hip hurray!++++@++++Please, you're embarrassing me.
Dad, we've got to do something.++++@++++What can I do? I'm only one man.
Lincoln was only one man.++++@++++Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.
Look, as the Safety Salamander, you are beloved by all. And if you were the Mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do.++++@++++Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!
And I will be your campaign manager!++++@++++And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
Homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that Salamander suit. You look like the mascot for some horrible Southern college.++++@++++Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna.
Uh, what special powers would a salamander bring to the office of mayor?++++@++++Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls.
Mr. Simpson, what about those photos of you strangling your child?++++@++++Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
I, um, I don't feel so good, Blue.++++@++++Hey, people may not love Homer Simpson, but they love this suit. Just like they love their stupid American flag.
What's that smell?++++@++++It's the smell of impending victory.
Did you just vomit in that suit?++++@++++A little.
Have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?++++@++++No, but I swam in it.
I'd better wash that thing. It's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.++++@++++But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
Sir, how would you restore our city's crumbling infrastructure?++++@++++That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all...
Si, si.++++@++++That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now.
We're sick of you and your hatchlings!++++@++++Please, stop throwing fruit!
Well, Dad, you tried to make this town a better place. And no matter what, that makes you my hero.++++@++++Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?
Yeah, I warned you about that.++++@++++Whups, be careful of my tail.
You don't have a tail anymore.++++@++++I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...
You're Lisa's brother!++++@++++Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one.
Sir, you wanna set the baby down? Don't worry, I just want to talk.++++@++++Silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
Tea? In the parlor?++++@++++You're like all Easter Bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! Maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. Oh, hey Marge.
This is my husband Homer.++++@++++Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?
Way to blow our tea, Marge. That's the last refrigerator magnet calendar you get from me!++++@++++We throw those out anyway.
My husband... and my best friend!++++@++++It's a risk I'll have to take.
We're on food stamps?++++@++++I wish. I made these at work.
I'm going out for some air.++++@++++I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
For your information, I am now a junior member of the Cheery Red Tomatoes.++++@++++Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that.
Oh... uh... uh... bird watching.++++@++++Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our "Peterson's Field Guide to Birds" on the kitchen counter?
Idioto! Idioto! Idioto!++++@++++Now, let's see what Marge is up to. "Recipes," "dress patterns," "toaster undercoating agreement"... "Heist plans"!
I got the combination from Burns after I let him feel me up during the Depression. Zero to the right... zero to the left... back to zero.++++@++++Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?
Why... you're all women!++++@++++I'm not!
I suppose, but you're certainly buxom and flirty.++++@++++Oh, well... I try to have a good time.
Oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. I'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and I'll let you go.++++@++++And tell me I'm not fat.
I just bought a new car. A nice foreign number... the Lamborgotti Fasterossa.++++@++++A Lamborgotti Fasterossa? That's the car I think about when I make love to my wife.
Yes, I need you to pick up my car at the factory in Italy, and ship it directly back to me. I'll save thousands in taxes!++++@++++You're sending me to Italy?
I think Dad may blow your cover.++++@++++That flag is mine! Don't mess with Texas!
Ooh, marriage!++++@++++Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield.
Gee, I wish we could explore a little more of Italy.++++@++++Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
Why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?++++@++++Why you little...
Dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?++++@++++Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup.
When Mount Vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death.++++@++++Savages.
We've passed the Ponte Vecchio bridge three times. I think we're lost.++++@++++Let me check the navigation system...
That's a DVD of a Fellini movie!++++@++++I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
Mozzarella! Parmigiano! Provolone! Pecorino! Gorgonzola! Fontina! Tallegio! Bocconcini!++++@++++Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.
It doesn't cover mortadella.++++@++++Nooooo!
Maybe there's a mechanic in this Tuscan village.++++@++++Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?
Scusi?++++@++++It's a Lamborgotti Fasterosa XT 550 with ABS Sport Tech package.
Ehhh... Americano?++++@++++Americano? What the Hell could that mean? Why can't you people learn to speak my language? I learned to eat your food!
Hey, she says the mayor speaks English.++++@++++I honor you and your country.
How did you wind up here?++++@++++Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist.
My tale begins after I had once again attempted to murder Bart...++++@++++Okay, so far I'm rootin' for ya.
This is my bride, Francesca, and my son, Gino.++++@++++Holy moley!
Well... I experimented in college, as one does.++++@++++Yeah, I never went to college.
Bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?++++@++++Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.
And literature is filled with tales of redemption, from Jean Valjean to the voice of Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen.++++@++++All right, Bob. We won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car.
Dad, don't act like Mussolini!++++@++++I thought I was doing Donald Trump.
Here's a cute fact. This sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.++++@++++Prego?
I feel so sick.++++@++++It's called a hangover, sweetie. And it's an unavoidable part of life.
Where is my roadster? You were due back a month ago!++++@++++Mr. Burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties.
Dad, you're driving on an ancient Roman aqueduct!++++@++++What am I supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?!
Hey, Krusty's in an opera, here in Rome! He can save our lives! Come on, let's go!++++@++++Opera? They have that here too?
Tell ya what, put on these costumes, go on the stage and mix in with the crowd scenes. He won't kill ya in front of all those witnesses.++++@++++Can I be the Phantom of the Opera?
Dad, the Phantom isn't in this.++++@++++But I do a great impression of him.
That's Sideshow Bob!++++@++++I know, and he's magic!
WHEN A WIFE LOOKS LIKE THAT / AND HER HUSBAND'S SO FAT, THAT'S AMORE! / WHEN SHE KISSES THAT JERK / WHILE I DO ALL THE WORK / THAT'S A...++++@++++Hey, knock it off.
Where's Reverend Lovejoy? He's never been late for Christmas service.++++@++++Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.
Now there's no one to deliver the sermon!++++@++++Did anyone order a hero?
I wanted you to tip me!++++@++++No tip till they bring back Hagar the Horrible!
That's not my decision!++++@++++Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call "The First Christmas."
Ohhh...!++++@++++I know, it's weird, isn't it?
It's not over, it's just intermission!++++@++++I said we're free!
'CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS HERE! Oy!++++@++++I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY
Merry Christmas, Homie. I think you're really gonna like this.++++@++++That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.
I knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me.++++@++++Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you.
So tell us, what's next for William H. Macy?++++@++++I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
Homie, what's wrong? Did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?++++@++++The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
I'd be delighted. But I must warn you, I don't wear a sweater every day.++++@++++Interesting. Interesting.
No, actually I salvage valuables from sunken ships. Some call me a treasure hunter.++++@++++Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!
Those are raisins.++++@++++So, you don't have any shrunken heads?
And this is the lady in my life.++++@++++Uh... you know it's a boat, right?
Indeed I do. I loved a real woman a long time ago but uh... it didn't work out.++++@++++I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
Listeners? I thought you worked for a newspaper.++++@++++No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!
Viewers? Wouldn't that be for a TV station?++++@++++Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!
Wha...?++++@++++I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson.
Dear God. I always dreamed this day would come. And now that it's here, there are so many feelings... I -- I...++++@++++Possible Daddy!
Homie, you just met this British man. It's too soon to get so emotionally invested.++++@++++Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!
And now that treasure is somewhere down there.++++@++++Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?
I was busy telling young people to get a haircut.++++@++++Mason, come see my room!
This guy.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Today I'm filled with joy: searching for treasure with my long-lost son. My dream for each of you is that you find the happiness I feel today.++++@++++And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
These waters contain some of Mother Nature's most stunning creatures.++++@++++Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!
How do I talk? Push this button here? You're all losers!++++@++++Oh, which way did Mason go? That must be him over there.
What the... hey...++++@++++I drew this picture of you.
It may not be much, but it's all I've got.++++@++++That is so sweet.
I gave you everything and it still wasn't enough.++++@++++Dad...
Well Homer, now that you're alive again, I'll leave you with your real family.++++@++++Wait. Can we have a moment in private?
And now there's something I've gotta tell you: I really am your father.++++@++++But how?
My old one's fine, but ya never know.++++@++++Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
It would be my pleasure... son.++++@++++Send up two hams!
No water fountain outwits Willie!++++@++++Listen... I wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.
Anything, son.++++@++++Teach me that the stove is hot.
All right, nap time.++++@++++But I'm not tired!
It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out. They use a proven concept, "tough hate", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. Then they send them home, quietly ticking away.++++@++++Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out.
Hey, check it out -- I made it partially risquÃ©.++++@++++Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!
Dad, if you take me to Vegas, I'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack.++++@++++Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system.
What's your system?++++@++++I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.
It seems he was our problem before. Your son's on the no-fly list.++++@++++Why, there must be some mistake.
Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out.++++@++++Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there.
Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Where's the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?++++@++++You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
Fight back, fun Homer! Together we can win!++++@++++It's no use.
C'mon, Dad, we got a long way to go. You can't stay mad at me the whole time.++++@++++Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act.
Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing I'm good at.++++@++++At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie.
Actually, Justin and I are going to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Sir Peter Hall himself is directing.++++@++++See Bart, I told you things could be worse.
Did you see that? They were eating melon for breakfast!++++@++++Look at me, I use a napkin.
Well Dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame.++++@++++I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son.
Well, I guess it's tinkle time.++++@++++Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare.
So, here for a snack before they roll you back into the ocean?++++@++++Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special.
I'm kidding.++++@++++Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
What?! No one dashie-dine on Stavros!++++@++++Why you little...
Hm, if I save you, what are you gonna do to me?++++@++++Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
Dad, I think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer.++++@++++I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling "you screwed me up"!
Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, I wouldn't be so screwed up.++++@++++Hey, I enjoy you plenty.
Don't worry, Mr. Simpson. We're gonna take his "sass" and turn it into "siss."++++@++++Thank you, Colonel.
Don't gamble on my love, Homer!++++@++++I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!
I've learned so much in my three hours here. I don't have to play pranks to feel good. I can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.++++@++++Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!
I'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!++++@++++And don't you try to stop us.
Actually, we were gonna call you, Mr. Simpson. Your credit card was declined.++++@++++Try this one...
Homer, I hope you get this. I'm in jail and I need ten thousand dollars bail. Hurry!++++@++++Uh, Marge. Me and Bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you see him, say "hey."
Well, tell your regular bully. He won't like it one bit.++++@++++Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney.
Sir, your go-cart's damaged.++++@++++I paid for fifty laps and I'm gonna take them!
DINING ON UNTAINTED MEAT / A TOILET WHAT STILL HAS ITS SEAT /++++@++++OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?
Big blue pants. When you no longer care if you're attractive to women.++++@++++Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?
Of course, but how?++++@++++Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet.
Well, what have I got to lose, besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?++++@++++How long is this commercial anyway?
Homie, what's that?++++@++++Huh?
On the back of your head.++++@++++It's called "headvertising." It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media.
Wow, it glows in the dark.++++@++++It's not supposed to.
AND WHERE SHOULD IT NOT GO?++++@++++BLUE PANTS! BLUE PANTS!
Dad, get your own song.++++@++++Fine.
I'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.++++@++++Well, it did its job. Everyone's wearing blue pants now.
What are those doing there?++++@++++Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. Except the Maine potatoes one. It's just a reminder to myself.
"Local Anahoopi Indians believed this stalactite was the finger of Tsisnajini, their God of pointing down."++++@++++Silly Indians. Our God made their god.
It's so impressive.++++@++++I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White.++++@++++Why you little...!
Well, we better start looking.++++@++++Don't leave me! I hate to be alone! Except when I'm watching TV, then leave me alone. But right now, don't leave!
I'll stay with you, Dad.++++@++++Will you tell me a story?
Sure. Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--++++@++++No unicorns.
One day, while I was savoring the exclusivity--++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Yeah -- it's like the play within a play in "Hamlet."++++@++++Huh?
Let's see... It's like when you watch old home movies of you watching TV.++++@++++Gotcha.
Scavengers... scavenge!++++@++++I'm bald!
Hey bar-boy, write a play where I meet Henry Ford and Captain Kirk.++++@++++Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!
I'm a little busy. Can I do it later?++++@++++Sure! You're gonna be all "I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"
Aw geez.++++@++++Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!
Oh, you poor man. You're about to get a lot poorer.++++@++++You didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.
Aw Dad, did my story make you cry?++++@++++Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!
That was the most horrible part of all!++++@++++Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding.
OH THE YELLOW GOLD OF TEXAS / IS WHAT I WANNA SAVE / I WILL NOT PAY NO TAXES / IF I HIDE IT IN A CAVE++++@++++I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
I need an operation?++++@++++That's a story for another day.
Why does God always need money?++++@++++It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?
How can you be sure?++++@++++'Cause he wants it.
And the winner is--++++@++++A living duck! I wished too hard and he became real!
There, there... the fact that you tried means everything.++++@++++Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.
Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl.++++@++++Just put it in the trunk and leave.
Let's do it again!++++@++++A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.
Â¡Ay, el Mundo es loco!++++@++++I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
Homer! We're not in high school.++++@++++So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.
Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.++++@++++Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.
Well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the S.A.T.: "Snuggles And Tickles."++++@++++Old Man Flanders!
Hey Homer! Sneakin' kisses from the Missus?++++@++++Springfield High football rules!
Dad, Mom's over at the Flanders', babysitting Nimrod and Nimtodd. We wanna do something.++++@++++Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.
Uh... sure.++++@++++I am gonna get them so wet.
This is much sadder than I expected.++++@++++Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.
Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream.++++@++++My son's been ape-napped!
Help! She's grooming me! She's grooming me!++++@++++Aren't you gonna do something?
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do now. A chimp that size could tear your son's head right off.++++@++++But she'll leave the rest of him alone?
Where's Bart? I haven't seen him since you came home.++++@++++Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen.
I could never think something that horrible.++++@++++And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you.
Dad, you can't keep this up for long.++++@++++Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!
Whoa! This Oreo is rank.++++@++++Bart! Bart!
Whee. Whee.++++@++++I fell asleep before the monkey.
Maybe there's another way to solve this. Bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for Toot-Toot.++++@++++Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.
While you were living the glamorous life of a TV chimp, I was raising my son. You have no right to take him away from me now. Please, please, give me back my boy.++++@++++Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!
Hey, I know how we can save Bart.++++@++++Mr. Teeny?!
Maybe he's getting married!++++@++++Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie.
I'm not wearing a hat!++++@++++I mean the one at the house.
Mother-Flippers? What's this show about?++++@++++How did Lenny get to be Newsfake Magazine's Man of the Year?
That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.++++@++++What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!
I've never seen a picture so highly defined!++++@++++Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch.
You don't mean that literally, of course.++++@++++You're right, Lenny. I...
Mom didn't say anything about high-def!++++@++++Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is.
Wow, there's a rainbow outside.++++@++++Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore.
The winner is, Bodell Jenks Junior!++++@++++Wow, I can actually feel the heat.
Beat it! This is my alone time!++++@++++Can you at least take a picture of me with the TV?
I ain't fallin' for that again.++++@++++Oh yeah, good times.
Homie, I've been thinking. We have been using this TV for a long time. So I entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen TV.++++@++++Oh Marge! I love you! I love you! I love you!
Now I really hope we win that contest.++++@++++There's a chance we won't win?
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You've won!++++@++++The big screen TV?
No. No one wins that. You won third prize: a tour of the Fox Network in Los Angeles, California.++++@++++All expenses paid?
Ooh, why look, there's Dan Castellaneta from the Tracey Ullman show.++++@++++Hey, funny man, say something funny!
Please don't lean out of the tram, sir, you might get hurt.++++@++++Don't lean out of the tra--
Oh, about enough to buy a new plasma TV.++++@++++That's just the product I've been coveting! Pick us! Pick us!
Not so fast. Are you sure you want your most intimate moments broadcast across the country?++++@++++Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.
Well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives.++++@++++Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that.
I got my tenure at twenty-eight.++++@++++Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?
I got my tenure right here.++++@++++Yeah, well I have full tenure.
You can call me Charlie. But do not call me late when there are scones about. Little British humor.++++@++++I'll bet the twist is he's gay.
I don't understand, Dad. Our family has so many flaws. Why must we share them with the world?++++@++++Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV.
Forget it.++++@++++Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair.
Oh, you needn't worry. I'm a bit of an elbow man, myself, actually. A bit different, a bit weird. Not sexual.++++@++++You take forever to say nothing.
Well, I thought there was no further way I could humiliate my husband. And then this opportunity came along.++++@++++I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room...
You know, I despise my husband.++++@++++Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either.
Charles hasn't satisfied me in years.++++@++++Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football.
Cruel, dusty years!++++@++++I don't know why I ever married that woman.
Now Homer, would you care to give your report on "C.S.I. Miami?"++++@++++Uh, okay.
Homie, I missed you so much! Put your pants back on.++++@++++Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!
Where is she? Where is the soul-sucking she-beast I call "Sweetums?"++++@++++Maggie? She's in her crib.
You're leaving me for him?!++++@++++So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman.
What brought us together is how much we hate you.++++@++++Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote "No" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt.
About a class of remedial reading students and their teacher who wants to be taken seriously.++++@++++I thought it was about her boobs.
And that's not your strong suit, big guy.++++@++++I'll show you all. I'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!
Homie, you've been down here for a week, I really think you need- What the Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise?!++++@++++Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!
It's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.++++@++++Maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
I am never coming back to this city -- and neither is the league!++++@++++You mean...
That's right! The Springfield Meltdowns football club shall never be!++++@++++You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.
Homie, you should give your Dad a call. You can't stay mad at him forever.++++@++++Yeah, you're right.
No! Wait! Wait! Bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!++++@++++Lisa's right! It is a cool, super sport!
Hell, yeah!++++@++++Ooh, a penny. This is my lucky day.
Distracted as if by a moral dilemma. A moral dilemma posed by a young boy... no, a girl! A girl named Linda... no, Lisa! The flutter of the cape tells all.++++@++++Hurry up and kill it! I have to be at the opera by seven!
Before we begin the movie, please join me in a moment of silence for the workers who gave their lives in an heroic --++++@++++Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie!
However, federal law requires I keep one union worker on the payroll. So congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet.++++@++++Woo hoo! I win! In your face, best friends!
You've been transferred to India!?++++@++++Hey, Marge it's what I've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury.
Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.++++@++++Oh my God, you're right! I'd better call the guy.
Whoa! He's gone!++++@++++What about her.
Aw Dad, we'll miss you so much.++++@++++I'll miss you kids too.
Attention: India Air Flight fifty-seven. Now boarding first class, small children and fat guys.++++@++++That's me!
Homie, I got you something to read on the plane.++++@++++Woo hoo!
It's a book about management, and Lee Iacocca says it's "definitely, dot dot dot useful."++++@++++Thanks, sweetie. I've never been less angry to receive a book.
Delighted.++++@++++Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!
Calm down, Dad. What happened?++++@++++A cow took my iPod and I punched it!
Yes, oh, you must be Mr. Homer!++++@++++Finally.
Classic. Now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!++++@++++Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say "um"?
Dad, I've gotta write a report on the Great Lakes.++++@++++Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.
I think he's in the house!++++@++++Outsourcing!
Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our American plant ever did.++++@++++Well, a little book once told me...
I see what you're saying. We're crowding your plate. In fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. Let's go, Smithers.++++@++++You're giving me absolute power?!
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a dinner engagement. I don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold.++++@++++I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.
Actually, in our system of belief, there are many gods.++++@++++Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof.
We thought maybe you would like to see some of our globetrotting adventures.++++@++++I am a God! I know all!
A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai! A-bom-shabai!++++@++++Silence! Now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant.
Homie, stop! You're not a God!++++@++++Marge?
Oh yeah? What's Mom's birthday?++++@++++It's... um... Jannnn... Febbbb... Marrr...
It's May!++++@++++May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
I'm proud of you, Dad. You're the first man to ever outsource the American worker's sense of entitlement and privilege.++++@++++Well, I'm just glad I'm not a god anymore. I wanna go home. How's Chief Wiggum?
He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.++++@++++Yeah, he's funny.
When is our food gonna get here? I'm starved.++++@++++I'm so bored, I figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats.
What about this swordfish?++++@++++My life's work ruined.
Finally, we shall bid goodbye to England and its drunken, decadent sinners.++++@++++Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!
Mother, we must protect him. Look, he's praying.++++@++++Oh Lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me.
And I will make thee a hat from construction paper!++++@++++So, thou art a widow, eh?! Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee.
Good sir, I do not approve of your fleshly gaze.++++@++++Oh baby...
I see you met our devout leader, Ned Flandish.++++@++++Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss...
Now I gotta warn ya, even for this day and age, I'm considered a bad husband.++++@++++She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
Well, I'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying.++++@++++Why thee little...
Perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!++++@++++May I escort you to the railing?
Stop callin' it that!++++@++++What-ever.
Homer, I can't believe I was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!++++@++++But baby, a man has needs.
Witch! Witch! Witch!++++@++++People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!
They're looking at me 'cause I have the key to the stocks.++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. I'll see to it you fundamentalist Christians live to take over all America by the twenty-first century!
At least I'm pitching!++++@++++Land ho!
Who else has a story?++++@++++I do!
I'll be fetchin' yer food right away. Six more games.++++@++++Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: "the nineteen seventies."
Goin' out with a sight gag. Nice.++++@++++I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
Homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!++++@++++...three... two... one... Happy New Year! My resolution is to be more fun!
Homer, what should we do?++++@++++Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom.
I've tied it off. You're all going to make it. Tell the world... that I saved you all.++++@++++Don't tell me what to do.
Dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us.++++@++++Or will ever do.
I can't wait to see this re-imagining of Itchy and Scratchy... by avant-garde director Juliana Krellner!++++@++++Hey, it says here "the book" was written by Tom Stoppard. This isn't a book, it's a play! Book.
AND DYNAMITE IGNITING!++++@++++Hey, check it out, I'm Scratcher or something.
Why, a woman invented liquid paper.++++@++++Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper.
Well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper.++++@++++Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
Um... I-I think a woman came up with nylon stockings. I mean, probably. We certainly use them.++++@++++Let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles...
Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody.++++@++++Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?
He's one of Bart's friends.++++@++++You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?
You never take our kids to the movies.++++@++++Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
I don't know. I'm still frowny with you. Do you really think women are mentally inferior?++++@++++Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude.
Well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.++++@++++Fine! I'll finish it myself. And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!
Dad, all you had to do was paint one number. Now no one's gonna be able to find our house.++++@++++But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.
Hey Sal Bando, give him a '74 A's "thank you honk."++++@++++My work here is done.
I have a delivery for a Scott and Brenda Weingarten, Seventy-four Evergreen Terrace.++++@++++Seventy-four? Oh sorry, there's been a mistake.
Oh, no problem -- I'll just ship these juicy mail-order steaks back to Omaha.++++@++++On second thought, I am Brenda Wine cooler.
Dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?++++@++++Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, I'm getting' rich-person mail. You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?
Oh Dad, no one can rationalize like you.++++@++++Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?
I'm scared, people. Truly scared.++++@++++Take that, liberal media.
"A highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax." But how could I have won? I don't subscribe to this periodical.++++@++++Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail.
It's hard to say. With retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient can forget years and years of her life. You just have to keep jogging her memory till it works.++++@++++Jogging?!
I didn't say you should be jogging.++++@++++Sweet!
Although you should be jogging.++++@++++Jogging?
Oh, you're sweet. I'm lucky to have such a kind... Uncle?++++@++++I'm your husband!
Wha--?!++++@++++I am! We're the same age!
But you're so much more... ravaged than I am.++++@++++I do eat a lot of crap.
I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot.++++@++++Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home.
Oh it's great. Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.++++@++++Why you little...
You strangle your child?++++@++++Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?
It hurts when I swallow.++++@++++Why you little...
Who are those freaks?++++@++++Those "freaks," as you call them, are some of our closest friends.
I know what the sun is.++++@++++Yes, now you do.
It's so great to have my children back.++++@++++I'd better get ready -- I'm next!
Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me.++++@++++Why do you remember them and not me?
I'm sorry. You seem like... a colorful character, but I just don't remember you.++++@++++Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.
What's snuggling?++++@++++When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--
Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you -- I'm not making love with you!++++@++++But what if we...
You're describing how to parallel park.++++@++++You used to love my non sequiturs!
We've got to tell Dad!++++@++++Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!
THAT HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S QUITE A GUY / HE PAID ME TEN BUCKS / SO I WOULD LIE / THE TRUTH IS / HE'S NOT SO GREAT / HE IS THE ONE MAN / I TRU-LY HATE...++++@++++So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.
I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!++++@++++Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
That sounds horrible!++++@++++No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?
I'm sorry you have to leave. But I just can't think of another way.++++@++++I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!
Look at this garden of F's. You planted them all!++++@++++Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!
That works for hiccups, not amnesia.++++@++++I know. I just thought maybe... boo!
How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?++++@++++Well, the rest of your life for sure.
Don't answer it yet -- savor the sound.++++@++++Marge?
Who the hell are you?++++@++++The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.
Go on.++++@++++You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off.
Dude, she's got three kids.++++@++++Really? Well she's still great!
You drink?++++@++++Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called "beer." And...
I remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!++++@++++But do you also remember that you're an enabler?
Oh, I don't...++++@++++And her?
Oh, and her.++++@++++And her.
Uh-huh. And him.++++@++++What about him?
I don't recognize that name.++++@++++Yeah, I have their baseball cards.
Oh, I know all them!++++@++++Look at all those people. You know them?
Wow, she still works here?++++@++++Yeah, she's over in post now.
Oh, I always liked that guy!++++@++++Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai.
Oh, and there's a familiar name. And another one. Wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? Did he get married?++++@++++Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!
I just had my first kiss.++++@++++When you get to third base, I'll buy ya a beer.
Homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!++++@++++All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
Sorry, loom-wads, new exhibit's in town.++++@++++Woo-hoo! Weapons!
Die, weapons, die!++++@++++Don't start the exhibit without me!
Wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there Homer...++++@++++Aw dude, I was totally here. You calling me a liar? In front of my kids? 'Cause I'd take a bullet for you, man. Right in my mouth!
Yaaay!++++@++++Oh, no you don't!
The nunchuck was invented thousands of years ago by a Chinese monk. Artifacts of the time indicate that this incident was hilarious.++++@++++Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!
You're leavin' already? We, we haven't even gotten in yet.++++@++++Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith.
So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.++++@++++Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
Dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?++++@++++My mind is always open to new ideas.
Why, I believe right now this gentleman's havin' dinner with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.++++@++++This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
Now, Bambi, who started that forest fire that killed your mama? Evolution? My, my, my.++++@++++Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...
Look, Homie, I brought you a beer.++++@++++Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!
As sure as I am that Jesus hates Hip Hop!++++@++++C'mon! Open! I want what's in you!
As a matter... Homer...++++@++++You, stupid...
This court hereby rules that the law forbidding the teaching of evolution is repealed.++++@++++Oh wait, it was a twist-off.
That was two seasons ago!++++@++++Now you can only see butts on cable.
Homer, we need those tickets to get in!++++@++++Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!
I concur!++++@++++Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!
Homer? Homer? Now we have to kiss. The big TV is telling us to!++++@++++Look at that ugly old man.
Give me a kiss, Homie.++++@++++Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
Hey, that was my iced tea. I just sweetened it to my liking!++++@++++Buck Mitchell!
Evenin', Ma'am. I uh... couldn't help seein' you two exchanging marital kisses tonight.++++@++++Yes, yes. The game you played so horribly at.
I was wonderin' if you and the mister could give us some marriage counseling. Ya know uh, in return, I can give you season tickets.++++@++++Season tickets?! I could entertain business clients. I might even land the Henderson account!
Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?++++@++++Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.
Homie, I don't think our marriage is so Jim Dandy that we should be counseling others.++++@++++Hey, we've gone through more hardships than the Jews and Charlie Brown put together.
Well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life.++++@++++That's just how I feel.
That's what I want -- carefree intimacy, with no edge of resentment!++++@++++Buck Mitchell!
Buck, Tabitha, welcome. We'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as Homer gets here.++++@++++Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy you know, and when we got hitched, I just assumed she'd give up her international recording career to focus on my minor-league baseball dreams.++++@++++Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?
Well, I'm positively sick of her shakin' her lady parts for the whole world to eyeball.++++@++++Interesting, interesting....
Maybe we should stop here.++++@++++Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?
Uh yeah, sure.++++@++++Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.
Isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? They're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now.++++@++++And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!
This house is spectacular. You must have had a great view of the riots!++++@++++I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.
You make me laugh, Homer.++++@++++Why, 'cause I'm fat?
Oooh.++++@++++Like I always say: compromise is the key.
I always say that.++++@++++Let's compromise and say nobody said it.
Hey, why don't you stay and have a bite?++++@++++Oh, you're so hot.
Oh Homer, you're sweet, but... oh, you're talking to the chicken.++++@++++Don't tell the hamburger in my car.
Listen, these shows always tense me up. While your fingers are greasy, could you give me a neck rub?++++@++++Okay.
Homer Simpson! You're supposed to be my marriage counselor. I did workbook pages for you!++++@++++Oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock.
There ain't gonna be a three o'clock.++++@++++Cancellations require twenty-four hours No-tice.
Dad, because you and Mom screwed up Buck Mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today.++++@++++Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull.
Oh, Papa.++++@++++I didn't want you to learn that word this way.
Listen, Bub. We are out of the marriage counseling business. And the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. But not me, 'cause I think they're disgusting.++++@++++Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act.
Then I guess you'll do it without me.++++@++++But I wanted to do it with you.
Where are you, sweetie?++++@++++Uh... she was here a minute ago. She must be pooping.
Well, Homer, it looks like my marriage is going into extra innings.++++@++++Great. But enough of the baseball analogies. They sicken me.
No problem.++++@++++Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits.
Actually, you can really keep costs down when you don't pay for materials or labor... or permits... or land.++++@++++Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!
You've raised a savage beast!++++@++++He's talkin' like the guy in "Fat Albert." Howba areba youba?
You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?++++@++++Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!
Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflÃ© and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower.++++@++++Why can't you do anything?
With Fat Tony doin' the morphine mambo, the Calabresis are gonna try to put him down for a dirt nap.++++@++++Dirt nap, eh? Hm...
Homer, our house is on fire! Help me save the children!++++@++++Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!
I don't know what to do.++++@++++This is all my daughter's fault. But I'll make it up to you. Bart and I will run your business till your Dad's okay.
Well, what do you know about being a mob boss?++++@++++Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: "Shark Tale".
This guy in here owes us money.++++@++++Leave him to me.
Look Mister, I-I-I don't got the cash. My clientele -- they're all bums. They never pay!++++@++++Just get the money.
Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!++++@++++Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!
Look, all-all-all I got is twenty-five. I swear! I swear!++++@++++It'll do for now.
Homer, where did you get that truck?++++@++++Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck.
Homer, Helen Lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. Could you pick it up?++++@++++No problem. I'll be back in ten minutes.
Dad, you want I should plug him in the ankle?++++@++++You monster! Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife.
Bart... Mr. Simpson. We are getting out of the mob business, right now.++++@++++But this is the only life I know!
I'm sorry. I just can't live with myself, seeing you this way.++++@++++Can I still talk with my hands?
I'm afraid not.++++@++++What about with my ears?
And I can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.++++@++++Lady. Man. Lady. Man. Lady.
Someone poisoned these meatballs. Homer...?++++@++++Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?
Class all the way.++++@++++Marge, could you let it go? You won. She's dead!
Oh dear. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.++++@++++Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
Why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?++++@++++I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
He's just drumming louder!++++@++++So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!
Just make it happen!++++@++++Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!
I thought you wanted me to drum!++++@++++I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!
I was jamming with Skinny Turner and Marbles Le Marquez! And they want me to join their trio!++++@++++Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!
Bart, a rising star like you needs a manager, and Gil's your guy! Oh, I'm a jazz daddy from way back...with the skit-skat skittily boom-de-boom, and the ding-dong daddy... is that jazz? That's jazz, right? Cha-cha-cha with the curly fries!++++@++++Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you.
Okay, guys. No one knows you're here, so be quiet. And if you get hungry, there are rats living in the Christmas decorations.++++@++++And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.
I feel so terrible. I just wanted to save those animals while Bart became a drummer... but I never thought the two stories would intersect.++++@++++And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
I guess that's it. These animals are all gonna die.++++@++++Not if I can help it, Lisa!
Do you have an idea?++++@++++Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did.
UMA SHANG SHANG / UMA SHANG SHANG / UMA SHANG SHANG. Is like eh, Bruce Springsteen the Boss. Ya?++++@++++I guess.
If you buy now, I give you tooth ache cream. Tooth ache cream.++++@++++Deal!
Uh, that candy's been here an awfully long time. I'd think twice if I were you.++++@++++Don't tell me how many times to think!
You are not bringing that thing home.++++@++++Then stand back!
Well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse.++++@++++We already own a book!
"Wisconsin From Above," "Veterans' Day Parades," ooh, "Smiles of Ireland"! Redheaded twins? Their mother must have her hands full!++++@++++Cool, a carpenter's library!
Well, I like the idea of you as a handyman... and I love the idea of you reading!++++@++++Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah...
Homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?++++@++++I did! I made a foot rest.
Don't you have any follow-through on anything?++++@++++What's the point? We're all slowly dying.
It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.++++@++++You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made.
Homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!++++@++++Yep, it'll do that.
Superlative! Please install a doggie door sized for a teacup poodle.++++@++++No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
I'm terribly sorry. I thought I heard the sound of a woman measuring.++++@++++Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: "measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."
Yes, but you're holding your hammer backwards.++++@++++Oh, uh... you know what they say, "hammer with the wood and it's all good."
Uh-oh, switch!++++@++++...Annnd done.
Mm-hmm! Simpson, you're a master craftsman.++++@++++Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?
Why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?++++@++++Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination.
Okay, gimme all your peanuts, Goobers and Fluffer Nutters.++++@++++Mmm... extra-virgin...
This is Shirley. Yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. Goodbye!++++@++++That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.
Homie... I think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. I mean, look at your t-shirt!++++@++++Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore.
Why does Lenny need a windmill anyway?++++@++++He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
And to think you built this whole thing with your own two hands.++++@++++Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh.
Are you ready to be lightly assaulted?++++@++++Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. "WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."
Homer, it's time people knew the truth: I'm doing the work and I want the credit.++++@++++Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster.
Mr. Simpson, shouldn't we begin by securing the struts?++++@++++Hmm... let me mull that over.
So what? He's paying us fifty grand.++++@++++And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!
Let's go home.++++@++++Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.
Dad, here's a thought: if you just gave Mom credit, maybe she could help you.++++@++++Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?
I'd like a Daddy who lived in the real world.++++@++++To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day.
Ooooooooooooooooooooh!++++@++++And now to get stinking drunk!
Dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!++++@++++Sure, I'll tell them the truth...
Oh my God, he'll kill himself! He'll never hear me say "I told you so!"++++@++++I've never felt saferrrr!
Homer, I was pretty upset with you, but in the end, I... I... I-beam!++++@++++Avenge me!
Look! A shooting star!++++@++++Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after.
That almost tore my head off!++++@++++You always find an excuse not to make out.
Dad, no! It could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!++++@++++If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?
How could you eat that goo? You don't know what galaxy it's from!++++@++++Marge, I ate it, it's over.
Homer! You won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?++++@++++Nag, nag, nag.
Is that the cat?++++@++++Uh, no. Just gas.
The flames are sealing in my juices!++++@++++I'll savor you!
Tell my friends I died kissing a girl!++++@++++No.
Oh, right.++++@++++Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!
I LIKE BIG GUTS AND I CANNOT LIE / DOUBLE CHINS WITH THE CHAFING THIGHS / WHEN A DUDE WALKS IN WITH THE HANGING JOWLS, AND MY STOMACH STARTS TO GROWL / I'M GETTIN' HUNGRY / SO I MASTICATE / CHOMPING ON THE OVERWEIGHT / I EAT FAT PEOPLE FOR DAYS / LIKE POTATO CHIPS BY LAY'S / TRY TO EAT JUST ONE, BUT IT CAN'T BE DONE / I'VE GOT TO EAT A TON / BABY LIKES FAT / BABY LIKES FAT++++@++++I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
Homer, I need to talk to you.++++@++++Dr. Phil McGraw!
You've got a weight problem, and you know it.++++@++++You're right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner.
Aren't you?++++@++++That's ridiculous, talking fudge.
Homer, your family's here. And you gotta help me help them help you help me help you.++++@++++Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
I have to be honest with you -- I can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.++++@++++What happened to "for better or for worse?!"
Dad, you're eating Dr. Phil!++++@++++It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.
Food does not equal love!++++@++++Marge, to keep you in my life, I'd do anything. There must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community.
Can't you read my writing? I didn't say kick Homer's "walls".++++@++++What's goin' on?
The cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.++++@++++Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!
Just write a scroll, asking him to stop.++++@++++Writing's for nerds.
We interrupt this dance music from the Meridian Room in Capitol City's fabulous Hotel Hitler, to bring you a special bulletin.++++@++++Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!
Astronomers say the ominous capsules originated from Earth's closest neighbor...++++@++++Flanders?
Mars!++++@++++So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side.
You know, Homer, we haven't actually seen these aliens.++++@++++That's alien talk!
Dad! A flying saucer blew up that statue!++++@++++Lisa, that was just a radio show.
What?! Homer! Our son joined the Army!++++@++++Eh, big deal -- by the time Bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! We're China, right?
Okay Mr. Simpson, we'll tear up your son's contract.++++@++++Sorry, guys. You know, his mother's the one who made me come down here.
Sounds uh, like you're kind of tired of being bossed around at home.++++@++++Go on.
Would you be interested in, um... I don't know, joining the army?++++@++++Wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
Hey, a big target like you will be home a lot sooner than that.++++@++++Woo hoo! Where do I sign?
We have this issue of Parade Magazine.++++@++++Ooh, "Who makes what in America." Army private: fourteen thousand a year.
Homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home.++++@++++I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
At-ten-tion! Ordinarily I would spend the next two hours questioning your sexuality, running down your hometowns, and telling you to drop and give me various numbers.++++@++++Are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'Cause mine is I care too much.
Here's your nicknames: Brooklyn, Hollywood, Kissimmee-St. Cloud Florida, Maverick, Blanket Hog, Newman's Own, Master of Suspense, England's Rose, Nickname Pending, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Snowflake...++++@++++Snowflake?! What happens to me in the summer?
A troublemaker, huh? You're gonna sit here and eat donuts, while the rest of the unit does push-ups.++++@++++I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?
Okay, listen up!++++@++++Man, you've got an awesome voice.
Well, thank you.++++@++++Can you say "Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"
Frontline infantry!++++@++++Everyone got an assignment but us.
Gentlemen, I'll be frank. Never before has the army accepted recruits with test scores as low as yours.++++@++++That's an odd way to start handing out medals.
I'm not handing out medals. But I am gonna give you a special assignment. The Army is conducting war games and we want you to play the enemy.++++@++++Are we that stupid?
So they're not shipping you overseas?++++@++++Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
Stay crunchy in milk!++++@++++I will!
Oh. Guess I'd better do my part.++++@++++Bring it on, chumps!
That's how it works? I was just drawin' wangs on the numbers.++++@++++Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!
The Salvation Army? You got it.++++@++++Not that Army, the one from "Stripes!"
Hey! They's usin' live ammo!++++@++++Well, what have we got?
That was our last Christmas card.++++@++++Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army...
I'd give anything to hear Homer's voice.++++@++++H means "hot"?!
It's not giant and it's not in the distance! It's small and it's in our room!++++@++++Predator drone!
Don't you dare go limp!++++@++++Hmm... Let's see what your hangover has to say!
Hustle your bustles, gang! We're going to the Senior Olympics to root for Grampa!++++@++++The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!
I wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.++++@++++Oh, I was supposed to take Moe fishing today! Everybody hide!
Homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives.++++@++++Says you.
Dear Pus Bag...++++@++++Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?
Thanks. So here's my digs.++++@++++Moe, you live in a hotel? You're just like "Eloise"!
What you've got here is poetry!++++@++++Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!
Thanks, Homer. I love ya, man.++++@++++Ooh, you love a man!
I don't care about my grade. I'm gonna send Moe's poem to "American Poetry Perspectives."++++@++++Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!
I'm gonna walk away then, okay.++++@++++Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
Homer, don't drink and drive!++++@++++Fine. I'll drive between sips.
Lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! We're going Vermonting!++++@++++It's gonna be awesome!
You guys go ahead. I don't think I'd be very good company...++++@++++Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!
That was my house, you moron!++++@++++Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.
Lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in Vermont. Except for those two dudes I saw gettin' hitched. Not my thing, but I wish 'em well.++++@++++Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!
Homer, would it make you feel better if any of that hit me?++++@++++No, not now.
So what? That's legal in Rolo-Polo!++++@++++I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.
Oh, in that case...++++@++++What'd I do?
Come and lick me, Big Boy! I said lick me!++++@++++You're not ice cream... faker!
Homer, there you are! What does my best customer want today?++++@++++One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please.
I wish I had more customers like you. I'm barely scraping by.++++@++++Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?
...ninety-nine-fifty... ninety-nine-seventy-five...++++@++++Nooooo!
You must be Homer.++++@++++Max told you about me?
And now I'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.++++@++++Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay...
You'll buy Max's truck?++++@++++Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right.
How can we forget? Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.++++@++++Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!
Otto, you totally pimped Dad's ride!++++@++++He was following my design.
Eh, what the hell.++++@++++You kids like ice cream?
I'm a unitard!++++@++++What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?
I do, but I'm lactose-intolerant.++++@++++Son, I will not stand for intolerance!
But my doctor says that I...++++@++++I said, God bless America!
Call the number on my bracelet.++++@++++Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
I'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.++++@++++You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?
Noooo! I mean, yes!++++@++++Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!
Aw, you're shivering, are you cold? Where you goin', Marge?++++@++++Honey, I brought you more sticks.
Homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. I'm as hopeful and full of life as I was in the years before I met you.++++@++++It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.
Well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.++++@++++Let me just put on some romantic music.
Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award.++++@++++Marge, everything looks wonderful!
You can't go to work! I need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!++++@++++Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show.
The show starts at three. You promise you'll be here?++++@++++I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you.
Hey, give me one of everything! Hey!++++@++++Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream.
Already? It's only thirty-eight seconds to three.++++@++++Marge's show!
See, statements like that are why people think we're gay.++++@++++I made it back for your show, honey...
Well, Homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. Good job. Very thorough.++++@++++Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families...
Oh, stop. Just stop. You don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!++++@++++Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
Mom! Mom!++++@++++Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!
There's Mom!++++@++++Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!
Homer, I wanna show the world how I feel about you.++++@++++The world's not that interested!
Homer, you wanted a sign that I still love you, so here it is.++++@++++Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.
Now I know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.++++@++++I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?
You're the worst husband in the world!++++@++++Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!
Don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!++++@++++You used to love it!
Dear Lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy.++++@++++And, as always, have fun watching.
Dad, don't make me go! I'll give you a back rub!++++@++++Oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. But you still have to go.
Look at our kids! Playin' like champs!++++@++++Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?
When you're done putting Lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day.++++@++++Woo hoo! Marital sex!
Dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?++++@++++But your mother smells like coconut!
Angelica Button and the Dragon King's Trundle Bed. It's the ninth book in the "Angelica Button" series.++++@++++Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups.
Oh Dad, I'm tired. We'll read more tomorrow.++++@++++Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.
No! We have to read it together.++++@++++Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night.
You must read ahead. Fiction is your passion!++++@++++Lady, you're nice, but I'm married.
Just read the book, you shaved ape.++++@++++Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!
Just take a peek at the title of the next chapter and see if you can resist.++++@++++An Unexpected Occurrence?! What could it be?!
Greystash.++++@++++He killed Greystash!
C'mon Dad, read the last chapter! Everyone says there's a big surprise -- I bet Angelica discovers that she's a wizard!++++@++++Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?
Come on, read, read!++++@++++Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
Why are you stopping? We're almost at the happy ending!++++@++++Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...
Is that really how it ends? What happened to the Merlinical Council?++++@++++Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars.
Dad, you can read to me anytime.++++@++++Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
Gee, you're really upset about this Greystash thing.++++@++++Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!
Homer, it's just a book.++++@++++No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!
Awwww!++++@++++Just think, Lisa, if I had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!
Grumply, grumply groo, I'll throw my net over you!++++@++++Look out! It's the Grumple!
Come on, Homer, let's get the kids out of here. Homer?++++@++++Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!
Yeah! Maybe I should spend the night here, too.++++@++++You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now.
But I haven't given you a present.++++@++++Your present is leaving.
Well, I figured since you invited me to stay, I might as well go down to the bus locker and get my stuff.++++@++++Marge, we have a problem here.
Grumply, grumply groo, your blood will make my stew!++++@++++Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.
I'll tell you why: Christian charity.++++@++++Christian Charity? What does a porn star have to do with this? He's gotta go!
I promise you, he'll leave after today.++++@++++Really? Who's gonna make him?
Well, I got something...a spider bite. Or as I like to call it, a "Christmas kiss."++++@++++Don't worry, I make six of those a year.
Wait, you don't have a place to live?++++@++++Lower the boom!
I guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...++++@++++Has the boom been lowered?
He's still in need, we have to let him stay. It's what Dr. King would want us to do.++++@++++Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors.
Please, just a few more days.++++@++++Marge, admit it -- you just can't say "no" to anyone. That's why you have three kids.
It's true -- I do have trouble saying "no." It all started when I was seven...++++@++++Yes we are.
And that's why I have trouble saying "no" to people -- even Gil!++++@++++Marge, I have no idea what you were just thinking about. Why would you think I did?
What'sa matter, Homer? Do you still miss the UPN?++++@++++Yeah, but there's something else. There's this loser staying in our house. Marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does.
Well, you can't kick him out, 'cause then Marge will never learn to assert herself.++++@++++Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!
Homie, wake up! I rented that negligee you like.++++@++++Those legs go on forever. Oh wait, they stop right there.
Homer, don't forget it's Valentine's Day! Whatcha gettin' the Mrs.?++++@++++A heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Well, I'm still a winner. As long as I've got a cup-a coffee and a tomorrow on the calendar, Ol' Gil's comin' back. Say Homer, how 'bout closin' up that robe? I'm seeing the whole butcher shop.++++@++++For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight.
A CREDIT TO OLD IRELAND/ IS MACNAMARA'S BAND.++++@++++Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!
I'll tell you what. We're going to Scottsdale!++++@++++Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?
Whoa, Gil's a big shot!++++@++++And to think, he and I once shared a shower.
I don't care how successful Gil is, he's still a mooch, and I need to tell him off!++++@++++A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me.
I was so happy on that island...++++@++++I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
This was my favorite seahorse. I called him Mr. Funnygoodfeeling... Oh God, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!++++@++++Oh Marge, I'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate.
Dip your berries? / Powder your jellies?++++@++++You could caramel my arm...
I make it nice and sticky, heh?++++@++++I didn't say "stop."
Homer, that's too much sugar!++++@++++It's not sugar, it's caramel!
Excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. What happened?++++@++++I bet it was Bill Clinton's fault.
No, no, it was long before him.++++@++++Slick Willie wiggles out of another one.
I guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember.++++@++++Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen.
Homer, this is wonderful. Where are the kids?++++@++++Oh, they're getting a little exercise.
Can I go again?++++@++++All night long, baby.
Aaahhh!++++@++++A green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:
Well, at least they left your underwear on. That was nice of them.++++@++++I think the hook is touching my brain. .
My husband meant no harm. There must be some way he can pay for what he did. He's good at opening jars.++++@++++Dammit!
I say let him fish it off. These waters are so barren, by the time he pays the debt, he'll be as old and as queer as I am!++++@++++Queer strange or queer gay?
None. Just a few slarg fish.++++@++++Ew, it tastes terrible!
No, you don't eat it. Its oil is used to polish stripper poles.++++@++++Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more.
Wait, this is bait! Homer, I told you to beer batter the shrimp and bait the hooks. Did you do the opposite?++++@++++Uh... I thought today was Opposite Day. By the way, you're very ugly. It's Opposite Day.
It's not Opposite Day!++++@++++So that means... it is Opposite Day.
We're gonna be rich! And it's all thanks to you, Homer! Or should I say... Chief Fish Clubber Homer!++++@++++I don't know what to say.
Oh Homie, I'm so worried. But if I concentrate, our love is so strong, I know I can hear your thoughts.++++@++++Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson.
Dad... I couldn't stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.++++@++++Aw, son.
They were gonna go to the Folk Art Museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. Not crush them, paint them.++++@++++You did the right thing, boy.
We're still gonna make it, aren't we Dad?++++@++++Uh... sure we will, son. Right, Captain?
Absolutely. Bart, the sea wouldn't dare take the life of an apple-cheeked young lad like yourself.++++@++++Should I hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
Not yet.++++@++++What's the code word?
In about two seconds.++++@++++Why you little...
All we do know is they're in Heaven now, hanging their lines off a cloud, and fishin' for airplanes.++++@++++The hell we are!
How did you make it?++++@++++Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly...
Welcome, Homer, to our watery realm.++++@++++Wait a minute. How am I breathing?
You're not!++++@++++Then when all seemed lost...
Lot of garbage fish today.++++@++++I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
Chill Thunder! "Chill Thunder"!++++@++++You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.
Outta my way, ya seatbelt wearin' cowards!++++@++++Hey! Nobody cuts me off!
Homer, no! Revenge never solves anything.++++@++++Then what's America doing in Iraq?
Papa, may we have petit fours?++++@++++May we? May we? Mais oui!
You're under arrest for treason!++++@++++Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!
Tell it to le baton!++++@++++I don't want the kids to see me this way!
I sentence you to life...++++@++++You moron! I'm already alive!
Hey wait, did you guys hear that? He just admitted it! Guys? Oh man, this place is so unfair.++++@++++Are you gonna torture me?
Now get some sleep -- you've got a nine a.m. Rat Helmet.++++@++++Nine a.m.?!
You're the traitor.++++@++++REVENGE! Okay.
Perhaps I may be of help.++++@++++Where did you come from?
I'm your cellmate. You never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered.++++@++++Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good.
I spent thirty years digging this tunnel, but now I can't use it. I'm simply too old.++++@++++And decrepit.
But you can escape -- and use this map to retrieve my buried treasure. With it, you can have your revenge!++++@++++Oooh, the the! But why are you helping me?
Well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, I want to know that I had one friend. Also, because while you slept, I violated you repeatedly.++++@++++So this map leads to a treasure, huh?
When we meet the count, do you think he'll like us? / I've heard rumors he's mysterious!++++@++++Madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen.
I've heard about these things. They're good for doin' the wife, right?++++@++++Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
Ma?...++++@++++I have returned!
Homer, you're back!++++@++++Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
Papa Meaux! Papa Meaux!++++@++++You guys liked him?
We were together for five years! Now who's gonna take care of the triplets?++++@++++But Marge, I did it all for you!
For me, huh? What took you so long?++++@++++It takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! Plus, in the middle, I had to take revenge on some of my contractors.
Weren't you listening? I just told you a whole story about revenge.++++@++++Oh, right -- revenge!!
Dad, wait, I've got a story about why revenge is wrong.++++@++++Is it "The Count of Monte Cristo?" 'Cause I love that story.
The point, Dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm.++++@++++No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon.
Look at that view. It reminds me how insignificant we are in the world. Yee haw!++++@++++This is it. It's taken all day, we've missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, I'll get my revenge.
Dad, wait! You haven't heard my story.++++@++++You? You're too dumb to tell a story.
You should feel lucky. Not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.++++@++++Parents who are still alive, I might add.
Hand over your wallet!++++@++++You don't frighten me!
So you see, revenge is great. And there's three ways to talk about it. Although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a Halloween story...++++@++++That's okay, boy. The two of us got to talking.
Look at all them stars. How many do you think there are?++++@++++Two.
What the?! Two?! You think there are two?! Well, I never, how could-- Why do you think it is that mankind is so inclined towards hatin' one another?++++@++++I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.
Tomorrow's Multicultural Day at school.++++@++++Now what do they want?
Aw, Grampa. We should take lots of pictures of him while we still can.++++@++++Camera's broken!
Homer, is that you?!++++@++++Floor it!
And that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? They had seven names for that.++++@++++Whoa, you just blew my mind!
Show's over, let's go!++++@++++What's your hurry?
Well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked.++++@++++Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News.
Hey, guys. I'll see you in a bit. I entered a thousand mile Baja Road race.++++@++++Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight.
Oh, man! What now?++++@++++Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!++++@++++It's dark in here!
I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? Oh, right. Darcy.++++@++++Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
What? Not you, Fibbing Bear!++++@++++You know, my great-great grandmother was an Indian. I guess I should've mentioned that before, huh?
I just found this note in Bart's room! "Dear Mom and Dad: Me and my girlfriend Darcy have gone to Utah to get married. F.Y.I., she's pregnant"!++++@++++Simpson men get the job done!
I did!++++@++++I mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific American, where...
Okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. In Colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum.++++@++++Actually... that was me.
"Dingle's Berries" in Provo, Utah?++++@++++Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy.
Our daughter says she's run off with your son!++++@++++Did she mention she was knocked up?
You know, I thought Darcy and I would be like a real married couple. Instead we just ended up fighting all the time.++++@++++Yeah, how 'bout that?
You know, for a while, I was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad.++++@++++Son, one day you're going to be a great father.
Aww. And someday you'll be one too.++++@++++Thanks, boy. Hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?
Homer is so amazing! He can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.++++@++++The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
I can't believe it. Homer Simpson... a bloody millionaire!++++@++++Why do you sound so shocked? This is our fifth take.
Wheee! /++++@++++Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well.
Can I use it on fish and chips?++++@++++I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!
What are you people doing in my summer home?++++@++++Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man.
I am an angry rich man!++++@++++That's the pool chemicals talking.
Oh Fah-ther, my pony Buttercup can jump ever so high-- Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns.++++@++++Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks.
Then I just want to know why your husband did what he did.++++@++++I'll tell you why.
It's the oddest thing: I actually feel affection for these knuckle-dragging sub-monkeys. I feel sorry for Homer Simpson.++++@++++I'll pay for most of this!
I have some footage to show you.++++@++++Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!
At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? No monsters have gotten me yet.++++@++++Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.
Homer! Don't kill the foreign man!++++@++++Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him.
The family can't start the day without me!++++@++++Relax, baby. While you were dreaming of me and calling me "James," I took care of everything.
Homie, you woke up early?++++@++++Eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. Now don't worry: I packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world.
Why do I have to go to a stupid psychiatrist? I told a scary story, big deal.++++@++++Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk.
And... My Dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. He's always passed out in the parking snot.++++@++++He's lying!
Dad, those kids aren't dumb. This show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!++++@++++Look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
Nooooo!++++@++++Permission to moan?
This basement is a wonderful gift to the family. But how could you afford it?++++@++++Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan...
Mr. Simpson, do you understand how bankruptcy works?++++@++++Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.
Under the new law, you have to pay your creditors everything.++++@++++What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says "Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."
Mr. Simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells.++++@++++Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money.
Uh-huh. Well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. Three subscriptions to "Vanity Fair?"++++@++++I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next.
Shut up! It's an instructional website! Shut up!++++@++++Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in.
I don't wanna leave! You promised me I could die here!++++@++++No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a "five-hundred piece" jigsaw puzzle in there!
Grampa's driving me crazy!++++@++++Why are you telling me? He's your father-in-law.
Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?++++@++++Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem.
For some reason, she doesn't trust him. Maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.++++@++++He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.
All right, lips, man your kissing stations! This is not a drill!++++@++++Well, here we are, home early.
I'm Selma.++++@++++A talking bear is eating my father!
Yeah, I know who I was kissing, and I also know why! I'm a little shaky on when and where, but I got my theories!++++@++++Well I never, ever want to see that again.
Ah, the hell with you. I just might ask that Selma girl out. And you can't tell me not to! My roof, my rules!++++@++++Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?
Pick a lane, freaks!++++@++++It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
Be nice, Homer. Don't you see how great it is that they found each other? Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog.++++@++++Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy.
Well gee, Homer, you uh, ain't exactly open-casket material yourself.++++@++++Words hurt, you know.
It's me -- Patty.++++@++++Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?
Look, if you wanna break up your father and Selma, I have a plan. But it involves you.++++@++++Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk.
Do you have your disguise?++++@++++Hola, I am Esteban de la Sexface. That means Stephen of the Sexface.
What the hell is going on here?++++@++++Dos Selmas? Ay-yi-yi!
Homer! Why would you try to break us up?++++@++++I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
Well, nerts to both of ya! Our love is so strong, not even a thousand crazy schemes could tear it apart!++++@++++A thousand, eh?
Dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!++++@++++Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet.
Walk with me.++++@++++Spooky.
Oh, I don't know, he might come home any minute.++++@++++Then I must flee!
I don't think we're doing this right.++++@++++Where is he? I know he's in here.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR HOMER / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!++++@++++I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers.
No, Dad, they're the opposite.++++@++++E-Z Blo...
It's okay, Homie. You're probably just tired from not doing anything all day.++++@++++Uh-huh... uh-huh...
You could buy a fireproof safe.++++@++++Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
Sir, we've been here six times this month.++++@++++Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad.
Okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. For me, it's the family photo album.++++@++++Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
It's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. So I made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation.++++@++++Tick tock, sweetie.
I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.++++@++++I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.
Oh man. I thought I was strong enough to get through this again -- but I'm not.++++@++++Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon...
Bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!++++@++++Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth.
And they pay big money for photos.++++@++++Marge! This isn't like you.
This is good. Real good! Like Lindsay Lohan looking drunk, high and bony. Click, click, career over, see ya in the gutter, freckles. Homer, I'll pay ya two hundred bucks. Bring me more snaps like this, and I'll make you a moderately wealthy man!++++@++++Moderately wealthy?
Wheeee -- I'm sort of rich! I can rent anything I want!++++@++++That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?
Sure, why not?++++@++++Then I'll do it!
Jerks like you oughtta be shot!++++@++++Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
Paparazzi?! Get lost, ya parasite!++++@++++How 'bout you, Gabbo?
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!++++@++++Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?
C'mon, baby -- barf for mama.++++@++++Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build.
Hello, Homer. Have you lost weight?++++@++++Oh, like you care, Betty White.
Tell me, how's Maggie?++++@++++Her name is Marge.
I was talking about your baby.++++@++++Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!
Dad! It's Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.++++@++++No problem. Hey Drederick!
Yes, how can I help you, my handsome friend?++++@++++Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!
That's what I think of the fourth estate!++++@++++What are the first three?
Nobility, clergy and commoners. Learn your French history!++++@++++Okay.
What the hell did you do that for?++++@++++I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.
It's eleven at night and I can't get to sleep!++++@++++Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals.
Bart gets another try!++++@++++That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.
Well, I do like the extra money. But I think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes.++++@++++See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down.
Okay, this is the place.++++@++++Did I attach the harness?
No! Should I attach it for you?++++@++++If you don't mind!
Do you, Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle, take Maria Shriver-Kennedy-Quimby to be your lawful wedded--++++@++++Up, up, and annoy!
Smile!++++@++++He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!
Sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. It's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine.++++@++++You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
And my sister once saw Burt Reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage.++++@++++You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.
I was gonna use it to take secret photos in the ladies' turlet. But no dames ever come in this joint!++++@++++Thanks, Moe!
We need to trade bras and panties!++++@++++How do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?
What are you going to do with those photos?++++@++++Nothing.
Moving on, our class trip to Italy is now spaghetti night at Papa John's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded.++++@++++Ooh, Papa John's.
Everyone can see you! Get inside!++++@++++Never!
Just put on a towel!++++@++++Why don't I just put on a dress?!
Homer, you've met my parents.++++@++++Not naked, I haven't.
Anyway, someone's here to see you.++++@++++...our duties as firemen.
You already promised you would.++++@++++Do I have to?
He quit! Being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.++++@++++Did someone say "snack"?
Dad, where'd you get that outfit?++++@++++I got fired from Foot Locker.
That was my father!++++@++++I'm your father now.
You don't even know the rules! This could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!++++@++++Hilarious joke?
Dad, I'm impressed! You've become a much better referee.++++@++++Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones...
I'm a spectator addressing a player, answer me!++++@++++I said foul on twenty-three!
Helen, please. Don't drop the "J" bomb.++++@++++Well I'm throwing you both out of the game!
Ow! She tripped me. Ow! Owww!++++@++++Foul on the other girl. Lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!
That is an outrage! Your daughter's been floppin' all day!++++@++++She has not! Your daughter's a dirty player!
How about a lecture from me -- Ronaldo?++++@++++Ronaldo?! Winner of two World Cups and three FIFA player of the year awards?
You heard Geraldo. What's it gonna be?++++@++++Yellow card!
You can't give me a yellow card?! You're my father!++++@++++When I put on these shorts, I'm not your father anymore. And judging by how tight they are, I'm never gonna be anyone else's either.
This is what I think of your yellow card!++++@++++Un-sportsman-like conduct.
It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.++++@++++Lisa, sweetie, I was just following the rules.
Yeah, in Idaho.++++@++++Son, I'll never understand women if I live to be forty.
Big if!++++@++++You said it -- enjoy me while I last.
Wanna go slam a few beers?++++@++++Wanna watch me?
What'sa matter, Homer and Bart?++++@++++Lisa's mad at me and Marge is mad at him.
Gee Moe, you give great advice.++++@++++Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?
Not interested.++++@++++It's a documentary... by the B.B.C... in cooperation with Canal Plus...
You were right to kick me out of that game. Soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of Europe and South America.++++@++++Those places are pretty terrible.
Do you want to play a little?++++@++++I sure do.
Homer, what took you so long? The game's almost over.++++@++++Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone.
I hogged it! I hogged it!++++@++++My son caught the ball! This makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
Not at all!++++@++++I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the "husband chair?"
Unless you're serving me a cold beer, you keep moving.++++@++++There must be another chair.
Uh-uh. My wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look "horsey". So, I'm gonna be here a while.++++@++++I guess I could just sit on a bed...
Wow, this is soft...++++@++++Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.
What in the name of-- Hey, you!++++@++++How many?!
Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?++++@++++Well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? It works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs.
That's the best endorsement I've heard since Mickey Mantle for Maypo! I'll take five mattresses.++++@++++I don't work here.
You do now, son! You're hired!++++@++++Woo hoo!
All this fuss for a baseball game? Why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?++++@++++But it did happen. Just yesterday, in Crazytown.
I put on fresh makeup for this?++++@++++Knock it off! He's just a kid!
Aw, hey that's the guy what created him! If Homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!++++@++++Hey, get off my case! He's the choke artist!
Was there even a baseball game yesterday? I don't remember!++++@++++Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago.
Don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?++++@++++Oh yeah, let's see where that goes.
Yes, I need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging, and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.++++@++++A common problem. Try this.
Homer, we have a friend -- actually, a friend of a friend--++++@++++Sex problem, eh?
Homer, please! They can hear you in fine china!++++@++++Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. And I've got the answer to your problems -- the Snugulux, by Matrimonium!
Oooh, sold!++++@++++And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. Okay, who else is dead in bed?
We're here about the mattress.++++@++++What's wrong with it?
We tried raising Cain but we weren't able.++++@++++Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong. Have you tried...
I know the mechanics of lovemaking, Homer! You owe us a refund!++++@++++I'll write you a check.
If you let us have your mattress, we'll give you ours.++++@++++On one condition: you do the shlepping.
Well, maybe if you go...++++@++++Wrong, wrong, wrong!
I'm sorry, Homie -- I want to snuggle, but I'm just not feeling it.++++@++++Yeah... something has changed, but I can't figure out what. Our mattress! I traded it to the Lovejoys!
You traded our mattress? I had my secret cash in it!++++@++++It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky.
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY, YAY, YAY... YAY!++++@++++Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
I'm starting to feel funny about doing this.++++@++++Look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here.
Homer, stop that.++++@++++Sorry.
How dare you break into our house, defile our bed, and smash our family photos with your foot.++++@++++Well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover.
Well, I am reminded of the story of wise King Solomon.++++@++++You would be.
I wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.++++@++++Or a chicken club... or a Reuben... or a Monte Cristo... or a... Pull over behind that billboard!
You really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?++++@++++It's like our honeymoon all over again. Aw, we even have the same bum looking at us.
Where's your father with those pacifiers?++++@++++I couldn't find Maggie's brand, but I got every other kind I could find. How about "Syntho-Nip?"
Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt? Larry Flynt?++++@++++Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just "see how it goes."
Are you counting sheep all night long?++++@++++Mm-hm.
Homer, I think you dominoed this.++++@++++That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads.
It was you.++++@++++How is that possible?
See? "May cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."++++@++++Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!
Mr. Simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?++++@++++Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs.
But users are losers.++++@++++You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
Why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?++++@++++Because I'm filled with stress!
Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?++++@++++Zombie kill.
No, play!++++@++++Zombie file grievance.
And that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...++++@++++Zombie montage:
C'mon, just one more.++++@++++What the?! My car?! Milhouse?! Nutmeat?!
You've horribly injured the whole fire department!++++@++++What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip.
That's just someone barbecuing.++++@++++Is that one?
Sweetheart, come to dinner.++++@++++I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.
That's the fire siren!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Just come back alive, okay?++++@++++Don't tell me how to do my job!
Hey, this is sweet, huh? Almost makes up for not gettin' paid.++++@++++We don't get what?
Of all the nerve.++++@++++Burns stiffed us!
Oooh, leather arms! People just give you this stuff?++++@++++Hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes.
No, no, no, the complete "Munsters" on DVD!++++@++++I hope it's spaghetti!
I can't believe he acted completely in character.++++@++++Lousy burns so ungrateful, I hate him so much...
Gentlemen, I'd like to thank you. You've saved my store.++++@++++Well... most of it.
Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes...++++@++++And some stuff I wanted.
Oh my, I didn't think the damage was that bad. But you must be telling the truth -- you're firemen, after all.++++@++++Yeah, we're awesome. This'll make a great toilet seat!
Uh, gentlemen... I'm uh... I'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here.++++@++++Just what are you getting at?
Just let the chemicals deal with it.++++@++++Look at me! I'm a fireman!
Well, uh...++++@++++Look at me, guys!
You're nothing but a diabolical master thief. The kind that haunts the slopes of San Moritz or the casinos of Monte Carlo.++++@++++We're not thieves, we're scavengers! Like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or America's sweetheart, the maggot.
You should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. Kids, get in here and show your father the faces!++++@++++Make them stop!
Oh no, wait, it's only four ninety-five. What's on your mind?++++@++++Moe, I think we may have perverted...
What'd you do with all the loot?++++@++++We sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
Styrofoam?++++@++++You stuffed your horn?!
Ooh, look! Pine-cone first ladies!++++@++++Where the hell is Abigail Adams?! Oh, there she is. Where the hell is Mary Todd Lincoln?! Oh, she's right there. Where the hell is Ida Saxton McKinley?! Oh I see. Where the hell is--
Dad, look, a corn maze!++++@++++Betcha can't solve our maze? I didn't come here to be insulted. We're leaving!
Maybe we should split up.++++@++++Split up?! Marge, no! We can fix this marriage!
No, no, I didn't mean--++++@++++Fine, you want out? Then go! I can make it on my own! Before I met you I had friends and dreams!
I was talking about--++++@++++Oh please take me back. The dating scene is a nightmare. I'm begging you!
I just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.++++@++++Deep down, I... I guess I knew that.
Now there must be a way out!++++@++++Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
That was never my plan.++++@++++I'm lost and I'm starving!
Eat some corn!++++@++++I don't have any holders!
This maze is too hard for me.++++@++++"To my wife Marge -- in case I don't make it, here are my Oscar picks for next year: Best Sound Effects Editing, the team from--"
Santa's Little Helper would be an awesome police dog! Can he, Dad? Can he?++++@++++No. And never bring it up again.
Please, can he?++++@++++All right.
I can't believe it. My own dog bit me.++++@++++Now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! Look at him eyeing me -- he knows I taste best.
I don't want a new dog. I want my old dog, the one who bit me.++++@++++Cheer up, boy. We'll get you their most vicious street cur! He'll bite your ass raw!
Oh, no problem, pally -- our pythons cost five dollars a foot.++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!
That's because I soaked him in slime!++++@++++Why you little... I'll teach you to trick your sister!
Homer, can you breathe?!++++@++++Well, I can breathe out okay.
Whoa, this is the source of the stench!++++@++++Hey, get your own yogurt!
Simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!++++@++++Woo-hoo! Business trip!
No, Jack, it's a joke name. You're being set up!++++@++++Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with.
What about the fat guy?++++@++++Hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!
I'm bulking up for football.++++@++++I'm still alive! You call that playing to win?!
Dammit!++++@++++This is our life now, Milhouse. We're dumpster folk.
Oh, sweet mother of Mary!++++@++++Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?
Well, the school's having a bake sale.++++@++++Ol' Betsy'll get us there.
So true.++++@++++Cops! Act natural!
Raisin cake! Who wants raisin cake? Don't worry, it's not too moist!++++@++++Can I have some more money?
I gave you ten dollars.++++@++++All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
Well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.++++@++++I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!
Yes there is!++++@++++Ooh, a thermos! With seven cups of coffee still in it! Oh wait, six!
Dad, that's a bomb!++++@++++Here! It's yours!
Oh, my special little guy. I'm so glad you're okay.++++@++++Oh, I'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!
It's okay. That was Shelbyville.++++@++++C'mon, everybody. Time for the family portrait. Let's bunch together now. Here we go.
Yeah, Dad.++++@++++Okay, here we go.
Make room for Jumbo.++++@++++What'd you say?
Praise the Lord.++++@++++You watch your mouth you little Smartass.
Yeah, Bart.++++@++++Nothing's gonna ruin this one. The timer's a tickin.
Bart's makin' faces, Dad.++++@++++Bart!
Oh Bart, you fall for that every six months.++++@++++Hey suckers, check it out. Marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery.
You're going to the dentist too, Dad.++++@++++Why the cemetery? I wondered. But my dreams were too strong.
Mr. Simpson, have you been flossing regularly?++++@++++Absolutely, all the time. I go to the floss store and they're like, "Whoa, there he is again." 'Cause I buy so much floss.
Well let's just get started.++++@++++Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!
I haven't started yet.++++@++++I know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth.
Don't worry, sweetie -- I'm sure that man has some special tooth problem.++++@++++I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!
This film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. Mixed signals, hmm.++++@++++This is the greatest movie ever!
Dad, that's ludicrous!++++@++++I have a right to my views.
Don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?++++@++++Sure do. Let's go get ice cream!
I can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!++++@++++I'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
It's a sundae that's fun.++++@++++I like that. But I'm on a bit of a health kick, so I'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: Snickles, Gooey Bears, Charlottesville Chew, Nice 'N' Many, Kat Kit, Herschel's Smooches, Mrs. Bad Bar, and Milk Dudes.
Cup or cone?++++@++++Uh... cone!
Congratulations! You just purchased the one millionth ice-cream cone sold by this store!++++@++++Oh my God, this is amazing! Wait, I'm gonna be driving. I'll go for the cup.
Tonight on Smartline, a provocative discussion of the Middle East... will not be featured. Instead, we'll be talking to a man who bought an ice-cream cone.++++@++++That's me!
All right, let's just get through this. Uh, Mr. Simpson, tell us how it felt when you bought the fateful treat.++++@++++I've never been to war, but I imagine it feels just like your first kill. The happiness swept me away!
No one saw my show... so no one heard my filthy faux pas! My career is safe!++++@++++Well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. That makes us friends, right?
Uh... hey look, it's the airport bus. You should get on it.++++@++++Okay.
And now to peruse the local news!++++@++++The happiness swept me away!
Even the map thinks you stink, Kent!++++@++++Oh.
That's because you're sitting on me, you lummox!++++@++++Kent Brockman!
I invited him to stay with us for a few days. His career is ruined, and I was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide.++++@++++I'm sorry Marge, but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the "liberal media".
You'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of Fox News.++++@++++Did you know that every day Mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.++++@++++Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!
And you're constantly flouting the law.++++@++++I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While.
It seems Liberals want to give NASA the right to "abort" space missions whenever they feel like it.++++@++++Liberals -- I hate them so much!
One thing I've always wondered: how can Fox News be so conservative, when the Fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? They don't fit together.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Liberals hate families...++++@++++Liberals!
And swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. Let's do it!++++@++++Hoo!
I guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.++++@++++True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!++++@++++I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. For years now, Fox has been--
...entertaining America with hits like "House," "American Idol" and "American Idol Results Show."++++@++++I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...
I guess this is the end. I just wish I'd spent more time at the office.++++@++++Hey, you're not a penny.
...me!++++@++++Me? But that's you!
Got it!++++@++++Uh-huh. See you at five then.
Hey Dad, have fun with your boyfriend.++++@++++He is not my boyfriend!
So Simpson, I hear you like pizza pie.++++@++++I do.
Chicago, eh? Well what if I took us there now?++++@++++Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.
/ Killer premise!++++@++++Yeah, but I'm on a plane, idiot.
And just so you know, she'll do anything for you. Anything except sex. And I do mean anything.++++@++++I'm aroused and confused.
Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie.++++@++++Oh my God... Lionel Richie?! Can you sing "Say You Say me," but make it about beer?
Sure, I guess. HEY YOU, BEER ME / BEER ME FOR ALWAYS, THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE / HEY YOU, BEER ME / BEER US TOGETHER, NATURALLY++++@++++Now make every word "beer."
We'll be back before you know it.++++@++++Svetlana! Svetlana!
Now I need a location.++++@++++I came to relax -- you think of it!
Finally, an emotion.++++@++++Drunk!
While you were here, we felt like New York!++++@++++I'm so happy!
Homer, you smell like Chicago. Did you fly there on a commercial airline?++++@++++No way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! I flew on a private plane.
Wow. Is it much different from a normal plane?++++@++++Please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
That's where you're wrong, Homer.++++@++++A fresh face!
This is Colby Krause. I hired him to help you improve your life. He'll get you back on a private plane in no time!++++@++++No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or "guru".
I'm a life coach.++++@++++Oh, tell me more!
The first step in self-improvement is to take a thorough look at your life.++++@++++If you're gonna film me, I insist on a body double.
Is Uncle Fester still alive?++++@++++The camera's not on yet, right?
Okay, now I just want you to do what you normally do.++++@++++Okay. Uh... well uh... hm, I just uh. I forget what I do.
Homer, before you even head out the door in the morning, you're already a loser.++++@++++Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch.
Homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer if you'd remembered the N.D.C.'s of concentration: Never Don't Concentrate.++++@++++Will you shut up? I can't hear the song in my head!
Homer, you're up!++++@++++This I can do!
Homer, here in the bowling alley, you're a totally different man: relaxed, confident...++++@++++Is this going somewhere?
I want you to wear those bowling shoes out the door and everywhere you go. It's crazy, but it just might work.++++@++++Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman, you're a genius!
That's not my name.++++@++++I wasn't talking to you.
Homer, your shoe attitude is bowling people over. These are letters from companies interested in interviewing you!++++@++++How many of those have private planes?
This one.++++@++++Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing?
They need a safety inspector to fly between their North American plants.++++@++++I'm gettin' that job. Bart, I'll need some clean urine. Stat.
You here for the safety inspector job?++++@++++Well, I can see the position of handsomest C.E.O. is already taken.
We're all so proud of you, sweetie.++++@++++I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy.
An opera star!++++@++++Uh, yeah -- I have no job and nowhere to go. What do I have to buy so I can sit here all day?
Well, with a coffee you can stay till lunch. Then you have to order a solid.++++@++++One small coffee, please. And a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it.
They're all the same maze.++++@++++Somebody's gotta do 'em.
So, how was your first day at your new job?++++@++++Oh, it was great! Flew to Tulsa on the company jet. Did my job in a way consistent with what I already told you. Because that's what you do. When you have a job.
I'm so proud of you, Dad!++++@++++Stop peppering me with questions!
Why aren't you at your new job?++++@++++Well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... I lied. I didn't get the job. You see when I got there...
You sure know how to repeat the joke I just told ya. But as a formality I must ask: do you know anything about copper tubing?++++@++++Um... um...c'mon, say "you're hired"!
Leave your resume with Cheryl!++++@++++Say it!
Security! Security!++++@++++Stop saying "security"!
But Dad, you've gotta tell her. She's been buying brand-name groceries.++++@++++Brands like "Miser's Choice" and "Day-Old Delights?"
It's bad news, isn't it? I should never get my hopes up. Nothing ever works out for us.++++@++++No, it's, uh... good news!
Well, anything for a fellow marine.++++@++++Yeah, uh... semper fudge!
Uh, did you just say "semper fudge"?++++@++++No, I said the right thing.
Look at this business center -- fax, Wi-Fi, teleconferencing capabilities... I'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!++++@++++Honey... don't try to remember the whole day. Just what you're feeling this second.
Sweetheart, what do you mean?++++@++++Marge... I've gotta be honest...
What was that?++++@++++I don't know. Maybe we flew through a rainbow.
Homie, what are you doing? You don't know how to fly!++++@++++I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?
All right, Homer. What is it you're attempting to do? Win over a difficult client?++++@++++I'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
Homer, I've gotta tell you, I'm not very good. I went to the Harvard of the South.++++@++++Duke? That's good.
Not Duke.++++@++++Vanderbilt?
Okay, Homer. I don't know anything about planes, but I know about you. You have what made America great: no understanding of the limits of your power, and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you. So you'll land that plane. And do you know why? Because I heard some guy say you couldn't.++++@++++What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!
Homer, you did it! You landed a jet!++++@++++And now, to taxi to the terminal.
And at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.++++@++++You'd think so, but no.
This concludes our service. Go now in the peace of the Lord.++++@++++So long, suckers!
We left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!++++@++++You'll never catch me, Lord!
Dad, all you circled were the "I's" and "A's".++++@++++Those are words.
Bodacious Frittatas? Buffet the Hunger Slayer?++++@++++I wanna say one.
Be my guest.++++@++++Denny's.
Every place has such a long line.++++@++++Don't worry, we'll just go home. Your mother can cook.
There's a place -- with no line!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house.++++@++++Lisa's right, son. Your Mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--
Hi... you!++++@++++Dude! You don't think you know me, but you do!
Oh Homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus.++++@++++Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood...
It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!++++@++++Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!
Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so...++++@++++Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche...
Excuse me. My brother twisted his ankle setting up the chairs.++++@++++Will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
Would you like to be a pallbearer?++++@++++Of course.
Please sir, a little respect for the dead.++++@++++My back! It hurts, and not in a good way!
Well, time to move on with our lives.++++@++++Stop that! I'm down here!
Homer, you have a mild back sprain. And you also ingested a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.++++@++++Well, you're always telling me I should eat more dirt.
Not dirt -- vegetables!++++@++++Which grow in what?
You know, Homer, your singing could help alleviate patient suffering, and save us a fortune in Demerol.++++@++++My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...
Well, young people are my future.++++@++++AND COULD I LEAVE YOU / RUNNING MERRILY THROUGH THE SNOW?
The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La BohÃ¨me. I want you to sing the lead.++++@++++But I can only sing lying on my back.
Places, everyone!++++@++++Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?
For the last time, it's not a movie!++++@++++Excuse me, "film."
RODOLFO, PERCHÃˆ SIETE CHE VI TROVATE GIÃ™?++++@++++HO DANNEGGIATO IL MIO PIEDE!
Yeah. But these seats are terrible.++++@++++MIMI!
My boy, you are a star!++++@++++Woo-hoo!
And you contributed to our culture!++++@++++Well I didn't mean to!
No, no. It's a good thing.++++@++++Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance.
The dance isn't till next week.++++@++++Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future.
Nice set, Homer. That was a hot one.++++@++++Wow, praise from Placido Domingo.
Call me P-Dingo.++++@++++Eh, I'll think about it.
You know, Homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. But you made me believe I was in a magical world where singing is talking.++++@++++Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third.
Wait, Homer, before you go, there's this new note I'm working on. Tell me what you think...++++@++++Hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor...
Like this...?++++@++++Keep reachin' for the stars, kid.
You know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage.++++@++++But I need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. Would you have me keep it fake?
Would you mind signing autographs for my mother and me?++++@++++My pleasure.
What is he saying?++++@++++I said you look hot! Hot! Ay Chihuahua!
Ay chi-what?++++@++++Hua-hua!
I want you to stop flirting with women.++++@++++No problem.
Sir, may I say I thoroughly enjoyed your performance.++++@++++And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?
Want us to take Marge shopping?++++@++++You guys go on, we're gonna walk home.
We're trapped. Your fans will rip us to pieces.++++@++++Not me, they love me.
That's right, I'm a woman!++++@++++A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?
That's a great idea! To celebrate, I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie.++++@++++So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang "Uh-oh Spaghetti-os". I'm hoping they send me a case.
Now listen, Homer. You can have me any time you want me.++++@++++Marge!
What is it, sweetie?++++@++++Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here.
She's perfect! For the first time since you became an opera star I can finally relax.++++@++++Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.
All right, Homer. I understand perfectly. You shall never be mine.++++@++++That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left.
Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!++++@++++Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.
Why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?++++@++++GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!
Let's go, Hagliacci -- or should I say, Madame Butterface! What? What? I had two.++++@++++Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular.
Come on, sweetie. Everyone's going to sleep.++++@++++YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA
Shout!++++@++++KICK MY HEELS UP AND
HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!++++@++++A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!++++@++++HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
Maggie's so clingy! Homer, hold her while I pour the milk!++++@++++No problem.
I sold it all to teenagers. There is a rumor you can mix milk, Mentos and Lotto scrapings to make jetpack fuel.++++@++++Does it work?
It's either milk... or paint.++++@++++It's paint. Or is it?
What'd I miss?++++@++++I've gotta find milk somewhere!
You want milk? I got yer milk right here!++++@++++At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.
Listen up, ya humps! Which one of yaz parked at the bank? 'Cause they're towin' yer sorry ass.++++@++++That's my car!
I'll tell you what. I'll give you a ride to the impound lot.++++@++++Okay. Let me just grab my registration.
I don't think my boss has a problem with anything I do.++++@++++Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy.
Well, he's in this truck right now.++++@++++But it's just you and me... That must mean I'm your boss. I'm sick of you! You're fired!
No, ya Dumb Dominic. I'm my own boss.++++@++++Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?
I don't call in sick -- I work when I want to.++++@++++Sometimes you want to work?
...and lasso the street cattle.++++@++++Street cattle?
The cars I tow. I got all kinds a names for 'em: She-atas, Hebrew canoes, spam cans, Swedish speedballs, and of course, stretch lame-os.++++@++++Some of those were pretty funny.
My blow better still be in the glove box.++++@++++Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God.
You know... if you're interested... we could use another hook jockey. The Springfield territory's wide open, since Flatbed Fred got killed in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.++++@++++I would love to! But I don't have a tow truck.
For five hundred bucks, I'll sell ya this old bucket.++++@++++I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
Not to worry. These are the ones you show at home.++++@++++Uh, that's still too sexy for my wife.
One, stick to Springfield. If I catch you on my turf, I'll rip off your head, vomit down your neck, pull out your heart, show it to your head, then shove 'em both down your neck hole, to which I previously alluded.++++@++++...which I previously alluded... Are there two "l's" in "alluded"?
Rule two, always keep your hook pointed out.++++@++++Why? What happens if I point it this way?
Stop! Stop! I'm entitled to park there.++++@++++Really? What's your handicap?
What the Hell are you doinG?!++++@++++I'm doing my job!
With those jerks out of the way, I was able to park right outside!++++@++++Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
Homer, where have you been?++++@++++Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end.
I don't want to live like that.++++@++++Hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be.
Well, no one's disputing that.++++@++++Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car.
Top of the mornin', Tow-mer!++++@++++It's Homer, idiot.
So it is! I'm just here to pay the fine for the Sunday School bus. You towed it with the kids still in it!++++@++++I guess I'm more powerful than God now.
You know what they say: "With great power comes great responsibility."++++@++++Who said that? I'll kill them with my power!
I told you to stay off my turf!++++@++++What? I'm still in Springfield.
We're just like you -- tow truck drivers who got greedy.++++@++++Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?
The truth is, we're just waiting for each others' hair to grow so we can braid it.++++@++++Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?
Dad? Where are you?++++@++++Do not worry. I am working.
Working? Where?++++@++++Ask no questions. And do not call the police, or I will kill me.
You sound weird.++++@++++All is well. Goodbye forever.
Oh, that's great. / Great story...++++@++++Okay, we've got time for one more.
Homer, you do know what tomorrow is.++++@++++Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times...
Homie! You're all right!++++@++++Thanks to her!
Well, I have to look good for tomorrow.++++@++++Right... tomorrow.
You have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.++++@++++What?! Name twelve.
Homer, you cannot miss Lisa's big day. And you have to come sober!++++@++++American sober or Irish sober?
Point zero eight sober.++++@++++Point one five.
Point zero nine.++++@++++Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.
Deal.++++@++++Goodnight, sweetheart.
And now the reason we're all here today... Lisa Simpson!++++@++++Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No.
Homer! I'm a hostage in a bank robbery.++++@++++What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero.
Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo, Oopsie, Carlos Mencia, Stinko, Blumpy... even worse than Sergeant Serious! How could I do worse than him?! I stole all his jokes!++++@++++Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!
I just want to go home.++++@++++You have a new home now... with us.
You're disgracing America's pastime. You should be ashamed of yourself... what the...?++++@++++You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.
You said you visited him every night.++++@++++Moe the tavern, not Moe the person.
Dwight, that was the most unselfish thing I've ever seen. I'm sorry I didn't visit you before.++++@++++Hey Marge, look at us -- the four amigos! They're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside.
You see, the problem is, we've grown apart.++++@++++The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you.
Greetings, Two Forty-One.++++@++++Why does he always bring up my weight?
I want you to eliminate this reporter: Kent Brockman. He found the gully where I dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.++++@++++Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!
Well I won't be home either. I'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains.++++@++++Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
Ninth floor -- assassin's perch.++++@++++Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself.
You just can't get Russian gangster blood out. Must be something they eat.++++@++++Hey, what's that?
How was your night?++++@++++Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing.
Homie, I made you my "killer" lasagna.++++@++++Seconds, please.
You're a killer for hire!++++@++++You ruined that pie!
How could you not tell me you were an assassin?++++@++++How could you not tell me?
I told you twenty times! You never listen!++++@++++Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge.
Listen, I...++++@++++Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids.
I get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?++++@++++I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
All those nights I thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!++++@++++I was out getting drunk, then killing people!
Stop it! That's my favorite couch!++++@++++Why do you think I'm kicking it?
It sounded like you were.++++@++++Hey, who wants ice cream in bed?
Great. Now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will "super dad" be then?++++@++++At your funeral.
I would have taken a bribe!++++@++++Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys!
I'd like to see you do a guy sometime.++++@++++That can be arranged.
WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE'LL BE KILLING EVERY HUMAN IN TWO DAYS / WE WILL COOK THEM / WE WILL EAT THEM / 'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THEM...++++@++++Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes.
Kodos the Destroyer!++++@++++Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy.
Open this door at once!++++@++++Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!
We know it's you, Mr. Simpson. Now where's the alien?++++@++++Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room.
Bart... friend?++++@++++Homer -- bored!
Definitely -- especially if you count the inside flap as part of the cover. It usually gives you a great idea of what the book's about.++++@++++Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!
Actually, I'm still alive, so technically it's vivisection.++++@++++No one likes a know-it-all.
Excuse me, but this is not good!++++@++++Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.
I've got something that will scare the H-E-double sippy straws out of them.++++@++++Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
Sloth!++++@++++Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti!
There's a bee on Maggie!++++@++++Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away.
Cool.++++@++++Way to go! Many happy returns.
Homer! The wedding's in twenty minutes! Just pick a tie!++++@++++There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?
Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?++++@++++And what color would that be?
You don't know what color my eyes are?++++@++++Of course I know!
No peeking. I'm wai-ting.++++@++++Uh...
You really don't know, do you?++++@++++Is "beautiful" a color?
Little help?++++@++++Spaz.
But why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?++++@++++Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me.
And until they do, you can stay here.++++@++++And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
Stop naming things!++++@++++I want to, but I can't!
Then go to Moe's!++++@++++Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!
I can't be a baby anymore. I'm alone now. I have to be a man! Thanks, Mags.++++@++++Where is it?
If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool.++++@++++Boy, stop talking to yourself!
Well, well, look who's strollin' down Alzheimer Avenue. You used to know everything about that wife of yours. Even wrote a song about her.++++@++++A song? Wait, it's coming back to me.
Oh Homie, I'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me.++++@++++Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love.
You're cool, you're not "mainstream," you wear a porkpie hat...++++@++++Mmm... porkpie.
"Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame".++++@++++Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?
We have a family.++++@++++A better one!
Yep, nothing beats living on "wife-support".++++@++++I hear that.
Yo guys, come meet a new husband!++++@++++Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!
My wife invented "SkyPills." She uh, mixed vitamins with Alka-Seltzer and pretended it was medicine.++++@++++I pay ten dollars a tube for those!
That's why I drive a Bentley.++++@++++Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get.
And they're not talking about cars.++++@++++Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.
Here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life.++++@++++That will never happen!
Oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day.++++@++++I do! I do!
Well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed Mount Everest and got everyone else killed.++++@++++Hey, the networks have different channels in this city.
That's okay. I don't care that you don't care. Go watch your thing.++++@++++Are you happy and full of life?
Really? But I'm so used to my old one.++++@++++Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me!
I'm going to the successful ladies room!++++@++++You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make.
Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a secret. I'm a first husband. I used to look like this.++++@++++What's your secret?
Oh, there's no secret. Just hard work...++++@++++Uh-huh.
...exercise two hours a day...++++@++++Okay.
...keep up with the latest fashions...++++@++++Fashions.
...and of course, cut out all fatty foods and alcohol.++++@++++Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge.
It's a very, very serious operation. You should only undergo it as a last resort.++++@++++Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore.
Very well. If you wish, we can perform the procedure in the office, today.++++@++++And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill.
Oh, get a life.++++@++++Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--
Dad, are you okay? I see food on your plate instead of blurring motions.++++@++++Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.
You had your hot dog plumped?++++@++++No, I had my stomach stapled!
Homie, I'm back!++++@++++Welcome home, Marge.
You remembered I like romance!++++@++++A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
You also remembered I like flattery!++++@++++Do you like guys who are... attractive?
Homie, you look good!++++@++++All for you, baby.
Let me get a good look at you!++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?
What are you hiding from me? Is it chocolate?++++@++++Uh, it used to be.
Whoa! Those buns are poppin' fresh!++++@++++Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now.
And I'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.++++@++++Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
You want me to unstaple your stomach?++++@++++No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?
And so, to honor her success, I bestow upon Marge Simpson this hundred dollar gift card to Sweatpants Etcetera.++++@++++Did someone order a super stud?
Listen, Homer, I gotta be honest with you...++++@++++You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
The doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. And I said no. But I did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man I love.++++@++++Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.
And Dad, I hope you learned something from this.++++@++++I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it.
Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with.++++@++++Aw...
Interested in a car stereo?++++@++++No thanks -- just here for a battery.
Big special on camcorders!++++@++++All I want is a battery.
Care to make love, sir?++++@++++Battery, battery, battery!
That'll be fifty cents -- or free, with the purchase of a $200 TiVO plus a two-year contract.++++@++++Sold! Sucker.
Sir, your TiVO?++++@++++My what now?
I've gotten so much accomplished: I saved "Lost", watched all of "Rome" in a day, and got through "Two and a Half Men" in two and a half minutes. Then I ran out of space and had to choose between "Sophie's Choice" and "Schindler's List."++++@++++Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?
Howdy, folks! Are you tired of family arguments over where to go to dinner?++++@++++Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
Why not try Wes Doobner's World Famous Family Style Rib Huts! The rib joint with something for everyone.++++@++++Good luck, with my finicky appetite.
We've got ribs...++++@++++Sold!
WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NIIIIIIIING... / BUT DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD!++++@++++THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!
There aren't any tables or chairs.++++@++++More ribs for me!
I see no grill, oven, or food of any kind.++++@++++More ribs for me?
Hello, Simpsons.++++@++++Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better.
And now you're all going to die -- just because you watched a television commercial!++++@++++Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can.
Before you die, perhaps you'd like to know how I engineered my ultimate revenge.++++@++++I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
I'm Wes Doobner.++++@++++Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--
Shut up! This time, to liven up my tale, I brought along some visual aides. Just call me... Slideshow Bob!++++@++++Nobody do it.
"The Hills Have Eyes Three: The Hills Still Have Eyes". And now, the moment we've all been waiting for...++++@++++Finally, the ribs.
He mocked my folksy ways!++++@++++He cheats at Uno!
Well, I guess the rest of us should pay our respects.++++@++++Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him.
Feet? Killing?! We gotta save Bart!++++@++++Now?
Bob planned this from the beginning --++++@++++Uh-huh.
He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!++++@++++Yes.
He would never get a Shakespeare quote wrong --++++@++++No.
His mother was a Shakespearean actress!++++@++++Oh yeah!
His father is a doctor...++++@++++A doctor, huh?
...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...++++@++++I remember.
...his father could take that opportunity to inject Bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.++++@++++Uh-huh.
It was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!++++@++++Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
Stop that cremation!++++@++++Hey, what smells so good?
You're too late, Simpsons!++++@++++Eat hobo remains!
Get me outta here. What are you doing? I can't breathe!++++@++++Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins.
Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob is finally locked up for good.++++@++++Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
Was you ever. You came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... the "Forget-Me-Shot."++++@++++A "Forget-Me-Shot?" Never heard of it.
You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog's eye, Absolut Pickle...++++@++++Mmm, pickle...
There was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.++++@++++Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...
Why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? Not that I am authorized to release that infor--++++@++++Flanders!
Fine, it was Flanders. Now since you know everything, who was Jack the Ripper?++++@++++The queen's private surgeonnn!
I had to -- I heard a hubbub, Bub.++++@++++What did I do?
You come to me for help rememberin'? That's like asking your horse to do your taxes, which I did back in nineteen ninety-eight.++++@++++I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.
Wait, I know someone who can help ya -- a doctor who helps people dig up old memories.++++@++++Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?
Punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.++++@++++Done.
Mr. Simpson, I have built a device that will enable you to explore your memories. The science was easy, but now I've got the hard part, coming up with a name.++++@++++How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?
Uhh...++++@++++Remembrance of things fast?
Hmm...++++@++++The Rememberererer?
Ah, my first Christmas. Such great Chinese food.++++@++++This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!
Now you'll feel a slight pinch... followed by an extremely painful pinch. Signaling that the spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.++++@++++Bo-ring.
Yes, that's right, boring.++++@++++Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!
Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way.++++@++++Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
Another me? You can watch the kids.++++@++++Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?
Yo, Homer! Can you take me to when you were ten to see if I can kick your butt?++++@++++Bring it on.
You're superior to me in every way!++++@++++Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer.
What is it you want from me? Money? Weed?++++@++++I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
Dad, you just destroyed your first kiss.++++@++++Who was it with?
Uh... Apu.++++@++++Right.
Hey, what's going on here?!++++@++++See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?
Duffman!++++@++++The mother of my children with the reason for my children!
I'm just givin' it to your wife. She is gonna be sore tomorrow.++++@++++Noooo!
Good one.++++@++++Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it.
Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you.++++@++++A surprise party?
I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.++++@++++Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!
Oh yeah! Duff beer is sponsoring the party, featuring new Duff Champagne -- the beer of champagnes!++++@++++Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.
My eye!++++@++++Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?
Homer, we wanna get him away from Burns!++++@++++So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid.
Homie, this is your party!++++@++++This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
Geez, Homer, I can't believe your plan actually worked.++++@++++What plan?
I've spit in every drink I ever served you. Bottoms up!++++@++++Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--
Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman.++++@++++And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here.
This is good for two free drinks.++++@++++Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.++++@++++Oh yeah.
Aren't you going to drink?++++@++++No, this is a moment I want to remember.
We can't leave work till you do!++++@++++Oh no! He's talking to that mailroom guy.
Time to make our move.++++@++++Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!
Don't you remember what today is?++++@++++When you ask me that it's never good.
I'm just really worried about your weight. Bart says that we got a call from NASA and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.++++@++++Marge, that was a joke!
There, there, Cheesy McMayor. No one likes weepy meat.++++@++++I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!
This election is on every channel.++++@++++C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!
I think it's exciting -- Springfield is the center of the political universe. I feel like a pundit in a think tank!++++@++++Think tank, eh?
But I was in "Die Hard."++++@++++Die Hard Two!
Opinions about the ads.++++@++++I live in that place!
Former governor Vincent Aleppo said in the New York Times, "I will protect the nation from attack."++++@++++He's got my vote.
But in that same issue of the New York Times, they also printed an article about terrorist leader Nussaf Al Mustaffi.++++@++++Dear God. What have I done?
And ye shall judge them by the company they keep.++++@++++Oh my God, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!
I feel exactly the opposite but the same.++++@++++That was the best milkshake ad I've ever seen. It makes me want a milkshake!
Stop all this pandering!++++@++++If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!
What're we gonna do? We can't not vote. Nobody does that!++++@++++Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?
Chief Wiggum!++++@++++No. But you're close.
Shockingly, this new face is now favored by fifty-three percent of likely voters. A new frontrunner has been crowned!++++@++++What I did made the TV thing happen.
Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter.++++@++++I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!
The Constitution? I'm pretty sure the Patriot Act killed it to ensure our freedoms.++++@++++Oh, the Patriot Act is so terrible! The government might find out what library books I take out. What's next -- finding out what operas I go to?
Dad, I'm freezing.++++@++++Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm.
We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!++++@++++I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore can't do anything right.
Hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets.++++@++++Like which kid's their favorite! It's Lisa.
We're in every kind of therapy!++++@++++Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
The nineties? Never heard of it.++++@++++Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created "Futurama," and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called "Melrose Place"...
Oh Marge, it's statements like that that make people say women are stupid.++++@++++A tale of two young outlaws in love...
Homer really did need those injections.++++@++++I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.
Did you two ever get back together?++++@++++Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.
Well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- Homie is where my heart is.++++@++++And once we were back together, I was too happy ever to grunge again.
You're right. But I'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, Britney Spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit.++++@++++For the next two hours, we'll be kid free. It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall.
This is a terrible Valentine's Day.++++@++++What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
And I love you, Tootsie Roll...++++@++++Happy Valentine's Day, and shut your gob.
While your car's in the shop, you can drive this loaner.++++@++++Loa...ner?
She's right here.++++@++++Wow. This is the kind of car you see in commercials! How much am I paying for this?
Nothin'.++++@++++Hm, it seems like a lot...
On the contrary. The loaner car is complimentary. It's standard policy.++++@++++Really? You people are idiots! That's the dumb-- What a stu-- I mean, that sounds fair.
Okay, so--++++@++++Look at you! Idiots!
Whoa, fancy wheels. What song does the horn play?++++@++++None.
Cut it out!++++@++++Wanna take a ride with your old man?
There's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.++++@++++Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to.
Really, Dad?++++@++++Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought.
You're right. I'm gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone I'm awesome.++++@++++That's my boy! Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it.++++@++++Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!
Did you just unlock the car from here?++++@++++Uh-huh.
I never dreamed an American car designed in Germany, assembled in Mexico from parts made in Canada, could be so amazing.++++@++++Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!
Jeez Louise. Are you okay?++++@++++Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.
It's your new diet!++++@++++But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.
Homer, did you know I used to weigh four hundred pounds?++++@++++I'll bet no man would touch you.
Well, I went from fat to "all that" using my simple, foolproof diet. It's all about little substitutions. Instead of French toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper? When you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper. Want a beer? Bell pepper!++++@++++It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!
Bell peppers! Pipin' cold! Crunchy and bland!++++@++++Three please!
You've gained seven pounds!++++@++++Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat.
Homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!++++@++++What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
Searching for evidence. I know your father's cheating on his diet.++++@++++Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one.
That's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.++++@++++Work.
It's four o'clock on a Saturday.++++@++++I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law.
Nothing!++++@++++Nothing!
I can't live with the guilt. I'm going to Martin's house... to end it all!++++@++++C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there.
Homer Jay Simpson!++++@++++Pudding power activate!
Let him have it, Marge!++++@++++Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you. I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.
Wait in line for a book? You tell 'em Bart says "Hey".++++@++++C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it.
Okay, I'm gonna hand out colored bracelets. The color on your bracelet will determine--++++@++++Move or die!
TV! TV! TV!++++@++++But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m.
Oh. Oh.++++@++++That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.
I think you've got a point! Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!++++@++++Go-go or boring?
You have a drinking problem?++++@++++I said secret.
Gay out?++++@++++Well wonder no more!
Dad... marinating with you is cool.++++@++++Thanks, son.
What the?!++++@++++Where's our jerky?
You have wasted my time! You have made a very powerless enemy. Good day and be well!++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?
You can skip the "K" and the "Y" -- I do not thank you and I will not come again.++++@++++Who could have done this?!
Well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints...++++@++++This can only mean one thing.
As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the "goshes" and "darns" in these Hardy Boys books.++++@++++I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!
Homer, you ate their jerky.++++@++++I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow.
Dad, you never win a fight with animals. Remember when you lost that war with the worms?++++@++++That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.
Dad! Dad, a little help?++++@++++You're on your own.
I need firsthand smoke!++++@++++Lisa!
A sturgeon is a fish.++++@++++And a very wise fish he is!
Oh Homie, I've been so happy lately. I'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! Now what did you want to say to me?++++@++++Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?
There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. Look at me, I'm glowing!++++@++++Maybe you're drunk.
Homie, Lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy.++++@++++Okay.
That's easy for you to say. You've never had to be thin and focused.++++@++++What'd you say?
I'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital.++++@++++I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.
Is it Bart?++++@++++Come on out, boy.
Who was that?++++@++++Wrong number.
Five minutes, ladies.++++@++++Okay, Bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.
What if someone catches him?++++@++++Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
For three boxes?++++@++++Hee-hee. Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes...
Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?++++@++++No!
It's night?!++++@++++All right, that's it, pull over.
You can just drop me off here.++++@++++I'll see you later, honey.
Order! Order!++++@++++Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together.
Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! But I forget how Mom felt about it...++++@++++Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news.
Ms. Lumpkin owed fifty thousand dollars in back taxes. With penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to twelve million dollars. However, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.++++@++++I told her not to go into one of those.
Shh! I'm more wanted than the last petal on a bloomin' onion.++++@++++Don't worry, you can stay with us. I'm sure Marge will be cool.
Listen, I'm sorry I called you all those mean things like, oh, I don't even remember...++++@++++Confederate degenerate?
Sadly, no. Most of my money went to my ex-husbands.++++@++++Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.
So that's it. She's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.++++@++++How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?
I made that hug happen!++++@++++Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!
Aww, well, you don't need a t-shirt for that, Tootsie Pop. 'Cause I ain't ever gonna leave you again.++++@++++Just sit still in my lap!
Yeah, all I see is a gut with knees!++++@++++Why you little--
All right, I get it, I get it.++++@++++Lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for thirty years?
Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag.++++@++++Well... it might be cold outside.
No problem. I bought you a hat.++++@++++Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.
AND HERE COMES GRAMPA WITH AN OTTER!++++@++++Song's over, Dad.
I'm really worried about Lurleen.++++@++++Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word "pop" out of all of our foods.
Uh, yeah...++++@++++Marge, my fringes are knotted again.
By the way, I'm Mary.++++@++++And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and TV movies. Regular movies, don't hold your breath. But TV movies, the sky's the limit.
Colonel, you're still my knight in white polyester.++++@++++Ten percent Lycra.
Babe, I need a hundred bucks for beer.++++@++++Ooo, I think he's a keeper.
So Dean Martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?++++@++++That's right.
But Wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.++++@++++Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.
Martin?! What's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?++++@++++Yeah, what's the deal, loser?
Can I join, Dad? Can I? Can I? Can I?++++@++++Son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--
Not this one.++++@++++Sold.
Oh man.++++@++++Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow.
I'll get your fabrics!++++@++++And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
You are now entering the killing floor.++++@++++Hmm... that sounds like Tress MacNeille.
Why do we have to get here so early? The football game doesn't start for hours.++++@++++We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!
It's just forks and plates. Didn't we bring any food?++++@++++The food is all around us.
You brought us here to beg?++++@++++Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching.
No, us!++++@++++Can I be Smithers?
No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson.++++@++++Why, 'cause I'm fat?
Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... no toupees...++++@++++What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!
And... let's roll.++++@++++Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!++++@++++"Film Festival," eh?
I can't believe I'm a director with a movie at Sundance.++++@++++Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!
I try to answer that question in my films.++++@++++What else?
I can eat a raw onion without crying.++++@++++Prove it, Hollywood!
Yeah, but I'm crying about something else.++++@++++What?
This is it! My premiere!++++@++++We can't wait to see it, sweetie.
I'm Lisa Simpson. And this is my family.++++@++++One, two, three... Another chute?!
They're like the family from hell on acid that's on steroids!++++@++++You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?
Oh, I was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life.++++@++++Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!
"Lisa Simpson's unflinching, darkly comic family portrait is the can't-miss hit of the festival. Landspeeder, do not Bantha, to your nearest cinema to see Lisa Simpson stab her family in the back with her camera."++++@++++Don't you dare post that review.
I'm sorry. You're too late. I have just hit enter, sending the wi-fi beams along their way.++++@++++Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!
Let me get a picture of you strangling my kid!++++@++++No.
Hey, we pay your salary.++++@++++I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.
Thank God they're not jeering at us anymore.++++@++++I know! Kinda miss it.
Lead-based toys! Lead-based toys!++++@++++Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!
Wow -- this guy could put Milhouse out of business.++++@++++Well, this is kind of a cute outfit.
Homer is a LARD butt.++++@++++What did you say?
Homer has booger breath.++++@++++It's a medical condition!
Homer is a big jerk.++++@++++Who told you these things about me?!
Dung muncher. / Stink brains. / Cheese wang. / Captain Crud.++++@++++I don't want to get mad, but I will!
YO WE'RE ROCKIN' OUT BALLS / Tub of Tard. / Crapper Clogger. / Fatty-watty.++++@++++That's it...
Uh, Mom? We've got a code four.++++@++++It didn't have to go down like this!
The door's open! I think someone broke in!++++@++++Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch "The Defender."
I hear noises coming from the kitchen!++++@++++That's where the food sleeps!
Who cares? If you kill him, we'll be on TV!++++@++++You're right, boy!
Homie, what's going on?++++@++++I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
Homer, I'm sorry I had to pretend to be dead. But it worked, because the government isn't looking for me anymore. I can finally stop running and be your mom.++++@++++No thanks.
Homer, I'm through protesting and chaining myself to things. I've realized that the most important thing in my life is you.++++@++++That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie.
You already ate the whole thing.++++@++++Well I'm not going to digest it!
Anyway, the Right Guard Keeping Cool Under Pressure Award goes to--++++@++++Oh, I don't even care.
Homer, are you okay?++++@++++I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
Sweetheart, when I left you, it was because I thought I could make the world a little bit better. Maybe all I did was make my own world a lot worse. I only hope you can forgive me.++++@++++No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!
I understand -- these things take time. Goodnight.++++@++++I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card.
I'm still with you, son.++++@++++Oh, this just gets worse and worse.
Come on, Homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever.++++@++++I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.++++@++++She said I didn't suck?
That bad.++++@++++That bad. Wow.
Sorry about your ma, Homer.++++@++++I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.
Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it.++++@++++That's it.
Homer, look what I found with your mother's things.++++@++++A donut from the future!
And lastly, for Homer, I leave you something very special.++++@++++Woo hoo!
At exactly three o'clock, release my ashes. I love you, Homer. And now, because they're your favorite, please enjoy some animal bloopers.++++@++++Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right.
It's not really avenging her, Dad. Just the fulfillment of her last wish.++++@++++I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected.
Hey, Homer! Your butt still looks big from down here!++++@++++Why you little...
You know, spiritually speaking, Grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... So, in a way... uh... I'm lying down now.++++@++++I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me.
Excuse me, I think I'm holding up better than you are. In fact, I've got energy to spare.++++@++++To spare, eh?
Guidance system destroyed. Launch aborted.++++@++++Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?
Judging from the wind direction... distance... time of day... the ashes must have come from... him!++++@++++Hm, what could I make from those two things?
You're not supposed to like it!++++@++++Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!
Are you hurt?++++@++++I don't think so.
Here's your mother.++++@++++You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble.
Hey, I've seen your wife. She's no Mamie Van Doren.++++@++++Just what are you guys up to?
I suppose there's no harm in telling you. I'm using the rocket to dispose of Springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the Amazon rainforest!++++@++++The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!
Well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals.++++@++++You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool.
Here's Gramma's knife!++++@++++Toss it down!
That's already a thing -- thimbles, right?++++@++++God Bless America!
But she'll live on forever in what you did today.++++@++++Well then, Mom, this was for you.
Thank you! Thank you! Wow, four thousand episodes -- seems like just yesterday Krusty stole his first joke from me. Seriously, though, I remember watching him as a kid, and I thought "I could do that -- and I'm a kid!" What I love about Krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!++++@++++Pee?!
Krusty Klovnen Baby Visker?++++@++++Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.
It's clown trouble. That's your responsibility.++++@++++I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
Yeah, well, we're adding clowns.++++@++++Fine -- but you just bought yourself "ear piercing" and "strange new feelings."
I don't know why I agreed to this.++++@++++Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now.
Wait, wait, wait! I'll start you off with this bicentennial quarter...and I'll throw in my man scrunchie.++++@++++Uh, we'll stick with the coins.
All right, time to fill these slots with coins. Specific coins? This hobby sucks!++++@++++Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time.
Wow, I never thought of it like that.++++@++++Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
You bet I do.++++@++++To your mother's purse!
Slide in the eighteen sixty-three confederate half-dime... and every slot is full.++++@++++This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
"...was mistakenly minted in December of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint."++++@++++The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. Son, we are getting that coin!
Nope... Nope... Dime... Button... Pepperoni slice...++++@++++Wait!
Nope... Nope... Nope...++++@++++Son, coin collecting's a lot like life. It stopped being fun a long time ago. But unlike life, I have a solution for this.
Our last item up for bid is a mint-condition 1917 "Kissing Lincoln" penny.++++@++++Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!
Five hundred.++++@++++Five dollars cash!
Ten million.++++@++++Objection, your honor.
Mmm... I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it.++++@++++Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins. It's really brought us closer together. That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him.
Yes, but the problem is, if you had it, I wouldn't. You see the difficulty...++++@++++Yeah. I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. Do you have change for a nickel?
Now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again.++++@++++You got it, boy.
I already don't! Homer, I've got great news!++++@++++I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
Homer Simpson?! You are a repeat offender.++++@++++Three-peat.
Bail is set at twenty-five thousand dollars.++++@++++I make that in a year.
We'll put up your bail money. Just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.++++@++++And if I don't show up?
Well, time to go back to my world of sleazy bars, tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons.++++@++++What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
So wait -- are we telling people now?++++@++++Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
Bullet-proof glass.++++@++++Flanders!
Maybe you're right. Maybe I should...++++@++++This case is "in the bag."
Homer, you could've killed him!++++@++++I sure could've, thanks to you.
Now I can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. Enjoy your shopping elsewhere!++++@++++Hey, Ned.
What the?++++@++++It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer.++++@++++Sure. What is it?
We have to do everything by the book.++++@++++And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
Did you just taser my coffee?++++@++++Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
Homer, can we take it easy on the taser?++++@++++No problem.
Our first bail jumper!++++@++++Let's roll.
Homer, take the taser out of your pants.++++@++++No, it looks cool!
Whoa! There's still bullets in some of these!++++@++++Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
What'd you get for me?++++@++++Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.
Dad, is this from a meth lab?++++@++++The biggest one in town.
This is evidence.++++@++++Evidence that I love my little girl.
A sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.++++@++++Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday.
How dare you?!++++@++++What'd you do that for?
Sorry, sorry muscle spasm.++++@++++I'm not convinced.
Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes.++++@++++Well, I like A.C.-D.C.
I like their Christian cover band: A.D.-B.C.! KINDLY DEEDS / DONE FOR FREE / KINDLY DEEDS++++@++++DONE FOR FREE
Hm. I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.++++@++++Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!
Man, that's harder to swallow than evolution.++++@++++You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you.
Not bad.++++@++++Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
Oh, kitten whiskers!++++@++++There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?++++@++++Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag.
Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!++++@++++You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
This partnership is over!++++@++++I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!
You know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas.++++@++++I can't take another word out of you!
Oh no! Those were for Mr. Smithers' commitment ceremony!++++@++++Marge, what's going on?
I hid it all in the one place you'd never look.++++@++++Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how.
Homie, what do you say we go to bed? You, me and the cake?++++@++++First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?
You jumped bail, Homer. I gotta bring you in.++++@++++What have you done to my family?
I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.++++@++++And how did you know I wouldn't be there?
Lucky guess.++++@++++Well, you'll never take me alive!
For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!++++@++++You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.
I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.++++@++++Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you.
I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in.++++@++++So, it's gonna be like that, eh?
Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?++++@++++Well, I'm--
Simpson, we're gonna put you away for a long, long time.++++@++++Make it life and you've got a deal.
Don't feel too bad, Homie. You'll be free tomorrow. And I used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me.++++@++++Oh, baby.
Bonehead.++++@++++Huh?
Lady, you are the best Mom ever!++++@++++Did he take the bait?
Bullies!++++@++++Hey, he went into a construction site!
What are you two doing in the laundry room?++++@++++We're doing laundry.
Dad, do laundry.++++@++++No problem.
Look at Bart go! He must be running away!++++@++++Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him.
He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.++++@++++Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.
Pull over -- Bart's in this field!++++@++++Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you.
Are we ever going to find him?++++@++++Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds.
Bart! Where are you, Bart?++++@++++Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god.
So I can't always be there for Bart. He's got to learn to take care of himself.++++@++++The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! It doesn't add up!
Where's Maggie?++++@++++Oh, uh, she's uh...
Look at me! I'm doin' something!++++@++++You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera...
Mr. Homer, why don't you forget your worries with this -- the last lottery ticket on the roll. They say the last one is lucky! Unlike all the others. Lucky! Or not.++++@++++Hmmm, you make a good case. I'll take it!
That is true. Another ironic "Tale of the Kwik-E-Mart".++++@++++You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
I thought it was fifty.++++@++++I was gonna bet it on the dogs!
Hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger.++++@++++That kid has become a Dennis-level menace!
Now Homer, boys will be boys.++++@++++Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
Oh cheer up, Homer. The drinks are on Lenny.++++@++++I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.
Dang that Bart! Thanks to him, I have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat.++++@++++Oh, you look great.
Why can't our son just behave?++++@++++Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant...
They're not boogers! They're clumps of rubber cement. That I stored in my nose.++++@++++Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!
Thank you for being a friend...++++@++++Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals...
Hm, I don't know. I'm pretty attached to my family, and...++++@++++Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!
Maybe I'm just not hungry.++++@++++Human garbage can to the rescue!
Father, could you--++++@++++Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said "No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--
Please stop spitting food on me!++++@++++Huh?
Keep your food in your mouth, you semi-literate spew-monkey!++++@++++That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!
Maybe he's going through... certain changes.++++@++++If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones...
Homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!++++@++++For your information, the "Daily Growl" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!
I don't like the look of those air quotes.++++@++++ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,
So now Bart is on his way to Aspen, where they're going to try to kill him!++++@++++Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!
There's Bart!++++@++++This looks like a job for Captain Crazy! Up, up and away!
Are you guests at the lodge?++++@++++No.
Your favorite, sir. Hot fudge sundae with gold leaf and diamond flakes.++++@++++Take me with you!
I can't listen to this anymore.++++@++++Nobody shuts out my blather!
Aw... young love.++++@++++Were we ever that stupid?
I don't know...++++@++++C'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it.
As the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!++++@++++Marge! I love this guy!
Put 'er there, muddy buddy.++++@++++He rhymes! Oh, happy day!
Really? Not married? And you were bicycling two abreast?++++@++++I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
Since two this afternoon. Welcome to our honeymoon!++++@++++Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?
Homer Simpson, I would be delighted not to marry you.++++@++++Then I now pronounce us "just dating."
I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!++++@++++Videogames -- the reason this generation of Americans is the best ever.
I can't believe Homer ruined another family picnic.++++@++++Hey, everybody pees in the pool!
Your neck looks like a sideways ass!++++@++++That's it!
GONNA DO THE LIMBO ROCK++++@++++I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.
That's the fuel gauge.++++@++++Uh-oh.
You haven't said you're sorry.++++@++++I know -- I was hoping the number might be zero.
And feel free to stay. We just put out the cheese -- we have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange, and cubes of orange and yellow.++++@++++A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge.
We'll stay for one hand roll or two Nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!++++@++++Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer.
Oh, for me?++++@++++No, get two of your own.
That's strong -- are you trying to get me drunk?++++@++++No, I'm trying to get me drunk.
You know, my horoscope said I'd meet the man of my dreams tonight.++++@++++Well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you.
You are adorable! Are you... alone?++++@++++No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!
Well then, would you like to limbo?++++@++++Limbo? You mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? Either way, I'm in.
EVERY LIMBO BOY AND GIRL,++++@++++Or you!
Why are you dancing with that strange woman?++++@++++She's not strange! She's fun! And she doesn't get jealous when I talk to other women!
How about a sushi fight?++++@++++Sushi fight!!
A log cabin? What am I, Davy Crockett? Also, who's Davy Crockett?++++@++++Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.
They're worse than wal-king!++++@++++I'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
I'll take ten bucks no-ow.++++@++++I'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye.++++@++++Why Flanders, you rogue.
Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds.++++@++++What?! But I have urges!
That's just your trouser devil talking!++++@++++He's not talking, he's yelling!
Aw, Maude. Your dead grandmother's pajamas. You know what that does to me.++++@++++I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders.
You don't need her, baby. Sylvia's got everything you want.++++@++++Do you have a pineapple pizza?!
Pineapple and pepperoni.++++@++++This is all going so fast.
Eh-eh-eh! First we make love, then we decide if it was a good idea. That's the European way.++++@++++I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?
Homer, I can be whoever you want me to be.++++@++++I want you to be Marge.
Why do married women always have husbands?++++@++++Marge, what are you doing here?
Uh... the same thing you're doing here.++++@++++You better not be! I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?
We sure did. Rekindle, rekindle... Okay, let's go.++++@++++Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.
Fine. But I don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.++++@++++I feel the same way about that lamp.
Okay, but first the chest.++++@++++Okay.
Homie, what's taking so long?++++@++++Listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. But you're goin' in the box.
And we'll stay up forever!++++@++++That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
Homer Simpson, you devil!++++@++++Well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside Boggle?
Homer Simpson, you devil! But I think we should unpack first...++++@++++Hmm, all right. The trick is to ease them off--
I can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!++++@++++You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again.
So... I'm sure you missed Marge last night.++++@++++Yeah. I missed her like five times.
What a charming single entendre. Now look, I know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever.++++@++++Forever? That would be awesome.
Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?++++@++++And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?
She's not here!?++++@++++Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg.
You make me feel that way too.++++@++++I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it.
Take my hand!++++@++++I don't want to let go of our special carving!
/++++@++++Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other.
Me neither, Homie.++++@++++I know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, American history...
I know. We had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. The important thing is, we love each other.++++@++++Awww.
Hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?++++@++++She blew it again! Woo-hoo!
Knock it off back there.++++@++++But we're married.
Okay, but keep it PG.++++@++++How about R?
PG-13.++++@++++Woo-hoo! Adult situations!
Lousy dog. If you had your way, I'd walk you every day.++++@++++Lemonade!
Any of you lugs wanna break up with my boyfriend for me? I'll buy you a beer!++++@++++Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.
Splendid! Shall we discuss music, or the weather?++++@++++No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up.
She wants to break up?++++@++++Yeah.
With me?++++@++++Yeah.
Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!++++@++++Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?
Is Lenny here?++++@++++Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead.
What? I just talked to him.++++@++++And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
Homer? It's your old roommate, Grady.++++@++++The gay guy?
Grady is breaking up with me?!++++@++++You'll always have a special place in his heart!
Oh, baby, you are the breakup king. You have made the seven minutes that I'm gonna go without love so much more bearable.++++@++++Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
What would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you?++++@++++Who are you?
Cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.++++@++++Surely some holds are barred.
No, none.++++@++++Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me...
We found a way to make this tournament interesting. We bet on the matches.++++@++++Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money.
Agreed. So, who are you gonna bet on?++++@++++I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.
He has a name, you know!++++@++++What is it?
I win!++++@++++She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!
Dad, I could actually win this thing!++++@++++And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed.
My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness.++++@++++You what?
In my young life I've seen that every time I'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says "you don't deserve this." And another little piece says "I agree."++++@++++Right, right. But will it happen this time?
Wish me luck.++++@++++Just be yourself.
I'll take your money. But I won't look you in the eye.++++@++++Fine. I won't look you in the eye.
Here's your money. Drenched in your daughter's tears.++++@++++You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental.
Dad? Did you come into some money we don't know about?++++@++++No.
You got highlights in your hair!++++@++++Uh... the sun did that.
What's goin' on?++++@++++Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad.
No, I'm not mad.++++@++++You sure you're not mad?
Hey, Mr. S... Lisa B...++++@++++Nooooooooooooooooo!
Would you like to buy some band candy?++++@++++Yessssssssssssssss!
She may never take back your name, but there's still a chance she'll take you back as a Daddy.++++@++++Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
Dad, I know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the New York Times crossword puzzle?++++@++++Well, I had a little help from this guy.
Take a look at the first letters of all the clues.++++@++++Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.
Um... I'm also returning this kitten calendar.++++@++++Kitten calendar.
I see you're admiring our MyCube. It's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination.++++@++++What does it do?
You should ask yourself, "What can I do for it?"++++@++++Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you!
Sir, it's not even turned on yet.++++@++++But it's glowing.
What have you done with the old ones?++++@++++Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
Salaam alaikum!++++@++++Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!
Bart forgot this, sir.++++@++++Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.
You know, Bart never told me he had a handsome teenage brother.++++@++++I'm really thirty-eight.
Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim, and therefore up to something.++++@++++Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view.
And she loved it!++++@++++Oh my God. What can I do?
Homie, it's very open-minded of you to have Bart's Muslim friend's Muslim family over.++++@++++Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging.
We met while studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology.++++@++++Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs.
Now bait the trap.++++@++++Why don't I get us dessert?
No, thank you.++++@++++What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?
I like the way you Italians think.++++@++++Shut up, old man.
I think it is time for us to go.++++@++++That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!
You're teaching Bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!++++@++++I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize!++++@++++Okay, I'll apologize.
Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything. Go to sleep.++++@++++All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it.
Heeeeere's Genie!++++@++++Now do Flanders!
No, now I will destroy your decadent Western society.++++@++++Nooooooo!
But I love blowing up buildings.++++@++++Oh my God!
Oh, it's you. What do you want?++++@++++I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
Mr. Simpson, I accept your apology. Goodbye.++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true?
That's Allah!++++@++++We'll look it up in the Corona.
Homer? I don't hear almond grinding!++++@++++Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you.
No, I...++++@++++U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Dad, it was an empty building. It was supposed to come down!++++@++++What about the bridge?
That was supposed to open tomorrow.++++@++++Did we really need a bridge there?
The Duff brewery is on that island.++++@++++I'll save you!
All the bees are dead!++++@++++Oh no, no bees? Oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?
Fortune Four lotto numbers are: nine...++++@++++Pfft! Knew it.
Seven...++++@++++Duh!
Three...++++@++++What?!
And...++++@++++Bo-ring!
But Dad, bees pollinate flowers.++++@++++Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
Honey?++++@++++Thank you.
Bees.++++@++++Worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!
...in there. Close. See these red dots? This bee has been felled by bee measles -- or as I call it, "beasles."++++@++++Animals can get sick?!
I'm going to talk to the girl from now on.++++@++++You're the nerd.
Uh-huh...++++@++++And mine was snakes and yours was...
Never being a grandmother?++++@++++Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself.
Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes.++++@++++The secret is not to swallow the stingers.
Dad, don't eat the bees!++++@++++They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart.
Listen Lisa, I was trying to think of a way to help your bees and I remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town.++++@++++Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it.
Silence! Now, let's make some noise for everyone's favorite basketball team, whom I have renamed the Springfield Excitement.++++@++++I knew it!
Okay, okay! Don't know why I had 'em in the first place.++++@++++I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.++++@++++Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
Actually Homer...++++@++++You and me?
No, the bees!++++@++++Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination...
Got the queen?++++@++++Yep.
Wow, this must be important, Dad! I've never seen you walk up an incline before.++++@++++Sweetie, I have a very special surprise for you.
He's not a billionaire at all!++++@++++Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment.
They sound awfully mad. Are they dangerous?++++@++++Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check.
Why do we have to go to the rec center? I wanna play with my friends!++++@++++When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities.
You're older. Why don't you do these fun activities?++++@++++Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye.
We could be murderers.++++@++++Could've been. If we hadn't had kids.
He found several undiscovered plot twists in "The Client." And he proved that the real villain in "A Time to Kill" is the legal system itself.++++@++++Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja.
Great! Here are a few "best friend" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. If her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--++++@++++Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it.
I just said that.++++@++++Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it.
Now remember, Juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior.++++@++++Use as many big words as possible. I call "computer." Bart, you can have "doorbell."
Nice doorbell. Is it computerized?++++@++++Hey! That was--
Homer, isn't it wonderful that my Juliet and your Lisa have become such fast friends?++++@++++If you say so, M'lord.
Dinner's ready!++++@++++If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands.
Oooooo!++++@++++When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?
I'll go get her!++++@++++Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?
I'm not that kind of doctor!++++@++++Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks.
That's chewing gum.++++@++++What a racket.
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we need to talk about Lisa. She's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own.++++@++++Well, that's Bart for ya.
We're talking about Lisa, your daughter.++++@++++Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son.
I search all the children's Facebook pages for unflattering references to me. By the way, I enjoyed the photos of your trip to Yosemite.++++@++++Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy.
I wonder if Lisa has threatened the Model U.N. with her rice tariff yet.++++@++++I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
A "castle"... I know where they are!++++@++++Wait!
You probably would.++++@++++What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
You got a letter all the way from New York City, and that's something!++++@++++And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad.
Homer, that guy's your age?++++@++++No, he's ten days younger.
So you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?++++@++++If he's lucky.
What about Sunday?++++@++++Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy.
Your father's just jealous because Vance was our class president in high school.++++@++++If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.
Dad, you ran for Class President?++++@++++Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation...
There they are, my favorite mixed-race couple!++++@++++Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
He looks happy.++++@++++Tears of a clown.
He's not crying and he's not known for clowning.++++@++++Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it.
Clear a path, boys.++++@++++Hey, Vance?
Hey, Homer Simpson! How you been?++++@++++Great, thanks. Listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?
Behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out. Oh. Oh here it comes! Oh yeah!++++@++++Please! You've gotta have some secret agony! I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
Got 'em from a buddy of mine with a store in Shelbyville. You want his number?++++@++++No. Yes.
Hey, Homer, you wanna try my new Vance Connor-politan? Like Vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated.++++@++++I'll just stick with my beer.
Yeah, me too.++++@++++Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.
Just let it go, Homer.++++@++++Al Gore?
Finally, you returned my shovel.++++@++++That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.
California casual or business attire?++++@++++California casual.
Right under this.++++@++++What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.
Homer Simpson...++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Please stop doing that.++++@++++, or woo hoo?
Both. Homer Simpson... Vance Connor... Fonzie... Homer Simpson... and the winner is Homer Simpson!++++@++++Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
Dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better.++++@++++That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!
No other foursome would have me. My legs gross people out.++++@++++Dondelinger!
Uh-oh. Looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.++++@++++Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me.
I can explain. But... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?++++@++++Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.
I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you.++++@++++I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.
With a virgin Tom Collins for me?++++@++++Virgin? What are you, a girl?
Very well. It's a fact I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't.++++@++++You lie. You love me!
Very well. Now we must once more stare madly into the sauce.++++@++++I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.
Oh, you could know. If you dared.++++@++++Huh? Who said that?
Now, watch the sauce of bubbling red and see the life you could have led.++++@++++Okay.
Ask-a the garlic bread.++++@++++Why? Why?
Homie, please, nothing good will come of this.++++@++++Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know.
Sorry, the only girl I could ever want is right over there...++++@++++...Debbie Pinson.
Nobody's ever asked me to use my head-brain before!++++@++++Homer Simpson. Class President.
Oh my God. He's talking to me.++++@++++A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?
Homer Simpson! I was gonna let you get to fifth base! It would've been something you told your grandchildren about!++++@++++Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me.
Who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?++++@++++I do! Oh, right.
I can hardly believe this is real.++++@++++Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline.
I don't know, but in this reality, I am not gay! Hubba hubba!++++@++++Sweet dreams.
.++++@++++Thank you, mysterious weirdo.
Tell me, what student government office do you hold? Secretary? Treasurer? Dare I say Secretary-Treasurer?++++@++++I'm Class President.
Well, that's what's missing. Our lives would be horrible without the kids.++++@++++Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah.
Slurp my snot.++++@++++I wanna live in the sauce!
Homie, please come inside.++++@++++Okay.
Dad, we need to have a talk.++++@++++Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?
Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.++++@++++Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.
Oh really?++++@++++My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.
Yep. In the future, people will look at this and they'll say "whoever he was, he must've mattered."++++@++++I guess that would be nice.
Pardon me... can my son have his picture taken with you?++++@++++Really? Sure.
Well, we can't all be Homer Simpson, son.++++@++++Thanks, guys.
Plaques come, plaques go.++++@++++Now let's get something to eat.
How 'bout Italian?++++@++++God no!
I hear there's a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.++++@++++Ooh, that sounds like fun!
It's the first day of school!++++@++++You're the government's problem now!
I can't believe we have to start another year of school. I never learned anything at that suck shack.++++@++++Who taught you that language?!
Kid at school.++++@++++So you did learn something.
Oh Homie, the insurance bill is due today. Can you make sure to mail it?++++@++++Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt.
Dad, Bart's throwing away his future!++++@++++Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
I.D., please.++++@++++Must be in the glove box.
Homie! What are you doing home so early?++++@++++Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house.
You mean back to the poor house?++++@++++Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.++++@++++Me too, baby. But we gotta get real.
We can discuss it later. Right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club.++++@++++Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you.
Oh my God! Oh my God! We're totally liable!++++@++++Oh yeah.
Apaches!++++@++++Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time.
No, sweetie. At this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. Who was I to think you could mail an envelope?++++@++++Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim.
There's twelve more boxes. And they all sound the same!++++@++++I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense.
What about my birthday party?++++@++++This counts as that.
Hey Homer, I have some distant relatives that I never see except for this party. Can I bring 'em to the party?++++@++++No problem.
Oh, right. We came together.++++@++++Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!
I noticed.++++@++++So, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not.
Homer, I always wonder, how can you afford this party year after year?++++@++++Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker.
Huh. I'm not sure that's how it works.++++@++++Fine, Mr. Skeptical. Give me back your beads.
But, but, but...++++@++++Beads, please.
Homie, do you know anything about this?++++@++++Marge, don't worry. It's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. They stopped calling us. In fact, everyone did!
I think we should go see our mortgage broker.++++@++++Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?
Oh, wait. I left out a zero.++++@++++Listen, you! When you gave me that money, you said I wouldn't have to repay it till the future! This isn't the future! It's the lousy, stinking now!
Don't be sore at the banks. Hell, we fired our C.E.O., and he barely got out with fifty million dollars!++++@++++That poor man. Is he okay?
I know, I know. But Bernice wants you out.++++@++++Don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. I ripped all the copper wire out of the walls.
Did you remember to disconnect it first?++++@++++Did I what now?
She is. Look.++++@++++Goodbye.
I need a place to store my cufflinks.++++@++++Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more.
Well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, I appreciate the sediment.++++@++++And on the zillionth day, God created hugs.
Come on, kids! Let's take our stuff back inside.++++@++++Uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. I left a little uh "surprise" upstairs for the new owner.
FOR HE'S A FABULOUS FLANDERS, WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY!++++@++++HE SAVED OUR ASS!
Homie, the faucet won't stop leaking.++++@++++No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.
Well, let's see what else is in the job jar.++++@++++It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.
He won't come over!++++@++++He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!
The rent check is late.++++@++++Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!
People like Flanders make me sick. If I was Marge's landlord I'd fix her pipes and I'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the South Seas and I... I'd never return.++++@++++Yeah, you'd treat her right.
Well, here's how you get back at Flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is.++++@++++Oh, right -- like "Dateline" did to you!
You want a cookie, Dad?++++@++++Yes.
I died when Homer sat on me!++++@++++Why you little...
Homer Simpson, I took pity on you, and what do I get in return? A kick in the kadiddlehopper!++++@++++Kadiddlehopper.
It's not funny! That's how I swear!++++@++++Fine. You're mad. What are you gonna do about it?
When the month is up, I want you out!++++@++++Fine. I'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!
Your leaving is our Christmas!++++@++++Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on Christmas, would you?
Wha? Who's that?++++@++++It is me, Jesus!
Uh, say, "Jesus," what was the name of the son of Zachariah?++++@++++It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
Hm, I wonder if it's theses.++++@++++Ew, that's gross.
Homie, I think it's an eviction notice. We're gonna be homeless, like Lucille Ball in "The Stone Pillow"!++++@++++Don't worry, Marge.
What's the catch?++++@++++I'm using you!
Right, 'cause I wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag, Sappho of Lesbos, and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty...++++@++++Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.
We know, Dad. We were there.++++@++++I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called "Bart's Mistake." We were walking home when
Flanders feeds me people food!++++@++++Well, I can't compete with that!
Oh my God. We're out on the street!++++@++++Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!
But kicking is the only toy I have.++++@++++That's not true. You have bug bites you can scratch.
Well, hasn't this been a peach of a breach! We'll see you in court.++++@++++Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again.
It's okay if you backslide a little.++++@++++Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!
I'm gonna see it first!++++@++++No, I'm gonna see it first!
Hit the road, ya big load!++++@++++My space toy!
For years... for years...++++@++++I finally feel like part of a family!
Now Simpsons, I must warn you -- any stress could increase the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs, leading to what we call "Tex Avery Syndrome."++++@++++Wolves are taking all our women.
You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!++++@++++You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
Dad! Come in the kitchen! Quick!++++@++++Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
Wha--++++@++++Great time to nap, Einstein!
Look at that -- one of God's discarded miracles.++++@++++Catholics!
Any child left here will be cared for by the Sisters of St. Teresa. Why would you leave such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?++++@++++'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!
No. The poor dear is right where she belongs. God help you, sir!++++@++++Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!
I'm married to Jesus!++++@++++Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.
Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent.++++@++++Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.
Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day. Can you hand her to me?++++@++++Um... No problem, sweetie.
Hm. You're not usually this greedy.++++@++++Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't know.++++@++++No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne.
You told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!++++@++++You told me something, but I wasn't listening!
I'm sorry for fibbing. Tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home.++++@++++Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.
Well that sucked! / There's a day we'll never get back! / I was so bored.++++@++++That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm.
What is that soothing sound?++++@++++Maybe it's beef stew!
Getting a back rub from an orgasm.++++@++++I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!
Oh, you mean the "YouSoup 5000."++++@++++Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?
Wait a minute, who am I pleading with?++++@++++Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!
Maybe we should get out now.++++@++++Interesting proposal. Now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
Hey, cool your jets! We're trying to get to sleep!++++@++++Hey, Flanders! Why don't you join us? Afraid you'll get your moustache wet?
One of us should go look at it.++++@++++Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.
The thing is, I ain't got much life left to live. And a wasted day like today is one I know I'll never get back.++++@++++Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions.
Well, there are a few things I was hopin' to do before I become dust in a jar.++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?
Anyway, I made a list.++++@++++Okay... "Pitch in the Negro Leagues," I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it...
That's right. Now let's make our reservations.++++@++++Lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
Everyone got jobs, that's what happened.++++@++++Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar.
D'ye mean it? Look, don't toy with an old man's heart, now.++++@++++Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
THIS IS THE LIFE IN IRE-LAND...++++@++++You okay, Dad?
So Long, suckers!++++@++++Well, Dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an Irishman?
Never heard of half this stuff! This brandy is fifty years old. Better toss it.++++@++++Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk.
I'm in A.A.++++@++++Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?
I'm late for a teleconference with Hong Kong, ya fat gob!++++@++++Why you...
Sorry, but smokin' in pubs ain't part of the new Ireland. Also, you can't text while driving.++++@++++Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?
Bite your tongue! That will never, ever happen!++++@++++Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm.
No, it's how you fly coach on Delta now.++++@++++Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!
What has happened to the ways of old?++++@++++People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!
Homer and his Da!++++@++++Well, "Da," it looks like all your "der" have come "ter."
So, it's escapin' you're thinkin' of, then?++++@++++I can't tell if those are questions or statements.
Son, this was all my fault. You were just trying to make an old man happy.++++@++++Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand.
Oh son, you know how I love a good analogy.++++@++++It was apt.
There you have it -- news has never been softer. What's that? The parson is here!++++@++++But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?
The Parson?! He's coming here?++++@++++Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!
Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister. Uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed.++++@++++You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real.
Who are you calling an old lady?++++@++++I need that paper quick!
Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.++++@++++Why you little bastard...
This isn't the most romantic place to get married.++++@++++Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world.
Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease, why?++++@++++Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?
Oh yes, Homer! Yes!++++@++++Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb.
Well, the last time I checked, pirates weren't gay.++++@++++How'd you check?!
That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.++++@++++Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.
No rockets! You can pick the frosting.++++@++++Chocolate.
All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation.++++@++++What if we...
There is no "we" in wedding!++++@++++But there is, Marge! The first two letters...
I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates! 'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding!++++@++++Why not?
Because their R.S.V.P. cards arrived one day after the deadline!++++@++++Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla.
You're going to be here a while.++++@++++But I have to marry Marge!
As of now, your pathetic little life means nothing.++++@++++Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression.
To remove that chain, you need the key to the lock.++++@++++You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!
The lollipop is made of hot sauce.++++@++++Whose side are you on?
...fun with fire ants?++++@++++What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic.
Wow, you're the smartest guy in that room.++++@++++Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm.
He's right here.++++@++++I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.
I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.++++@++++Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
And with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. Next!++++@++++I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding.
Just what I always wanted.++++@++++A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!
Oh, ya hate to see this.++++@++++I love to see this!
Hold the Black Label, Mabel! The Utica Mohawks' Pete Mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!++++@++++Stop him, Babando!
You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.++++@++++I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends.
So that will do it from Wayne Bockhorn, Jean-Pierre PÃ©tomane, and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde, here at Utica's Kill-Kwik Rat Poison Arena.++++@++++Wha-wha-what's the score?!
Now stay tuned for "Picking the Perfect Apple," it's already in progress.++++@++++The score, damn you!
You want to know the score? I'll tell you the score.++++@++++Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage.
Here's the score, Mister:++++@++++Yes?
Your daughter barely knows who you are!++++@++++That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?
Maggie.++++@++++Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high.
Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie?++++@++++Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!
Huh. I got a window here.++++@++++Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?
Ooh, hey Maggie! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!++++@++++Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.
'Cause he can't remember limericks?++++@++++I can too! "There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh...
It's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!++++@++++There you are!
Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie?++++@++++How would I know?
You've been spending so much time with her.++++@++++I have not! Oh right, you think I do.
Here she is, uh, Homer. The wonderful girl I been tellin' you about.++++@++++Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about.
Well... If I remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine...++++@++++Man oh man, slap a ring on that!
All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to.++++@++++Here we are, Maggie. That park you love...
Okay, no more delays. I've got to watch this.++++@++++I'll save you, Maggie!
Homer Simpson, you are a strong finisher.++++@++++And I'm good at beginnings.
What's the matter, Homer?++++@++++Not a thing in the world.
Yeah, I wish I could say the same.++++@++++Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile.
Chocolate chip for Donald, low sodium for Abe, "not made by immigrants" for Sam, and imaginary for Major Preston...++++@++++Don't shake your fist at me!
I spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. Why, here he is now. Lookin' good, Homer!++++@++++Boy.
Just wait.++++@++++Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?
We believe Lisa is suffering from Environment Related Despair.++++@++++Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name.
Lisa is a little young to be taking "happy pills."++++@++++Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do.
Um, if this girl I'm seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldn't mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes.++++@++++Yeah, busboys get all the chicks.
I can't believe she dumped me!++++@++++Son, girls come and go. But you'll always have your family.
Maybe we should just check out the street performers.++++@++++Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.
I can't wait to tell everyone!++++@++++Oh, this is great, honey. Thanks for telling me about it. I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny.
Dad, yes!++++@++++Water!
No it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!++++@++++Is it 'omplimentawee?
Yeah, sure. It's complimentary.++++@++++It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!
Oh, I thought that was a Y, for "yanky." I'll make a note in your chart that you aren't always clear.++++@++++Well, at least I can eat again!
Homer, you have become a super-taster. The mildest spices will overwhelm your tongue. Even a taco could drive you insane.++++@++++I can't eat tacos?! Oh my God -- what day of Mayo is it?
Cinco.++++@++++Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Try these beets. I boiled all the red out.++++@++++I still taste over-tones of pink!
Dad, I've got the perfect thing.++++@++++Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.
It's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. The blandest food known to man.++++@++++What else do they got?
Pecan blandies... cream of steam... You Guess 'Ems...++++@++++Man, who comes up with this stuff?
Lunch card... Lunch card... Lunch card?++++@++++Don't have one.
Dad, what are you doing here?++++@++++Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!
What? No!++++@++++Oh, come on, relax, I won't embarrass you.
Three dollars and eighty-five cents.++++@++++Uh... can I work it off? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.
I'll start you on Jell-o.++++@++++OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O
I used to date your daughter.++++@++++Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation.
Dad, do you have to hang out at my school? It's bad enough I have to be here three days a week!++++@++++Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?
Albany! Annapolis Atlanta! Augusta! Austin! Baton Rouge! Bismarck! Boise! Boston! Capital City! Carson City!++++@++++Wow, he's terrified of you.
That's why I'm here -- to make sure he gets good grades.++++@++++Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?
Well, call me over-involved, but some day your son will be my son's chauffeur.++++@++++Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.
It's not your son's fault, it's yours. You have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. It's called "helicopter parenting."++++@++++I don't have to "helicopter" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called "Lisa."
Well, I...++++@++++No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
Noah. I like that name. No-ahhh. Noah. Noah!++++@++++Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
Am I?++++@++++If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!++++@++++There's no future in that!
Don't forget, children -- Monday is the balsa-wood model-building competition. The American Balsa Council will award this year's winner a thousand-dollar savings bond for their college education.++++@++++A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!
My mistake.++++@++++I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!
Dad, if I join a clique, I'll be the kind of person I hate.++++@++++Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples.
Hmm, well, they are good ones.++++@++++And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats...
Well that's very nice of you-- Hey! You sayin' my clothes are clown-like? Oh God, I feel so insecure! Please be my friend...++++@++++See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?
I do! / Yeah! / You know it! / Oh boy!++++@++++Ooo, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean everyone everyone. Hope you don't mind.
If I didn't sell booze, they probably wouldn't even come here.++++@++++And that, my dear girl, is called the Toledo Take-back.
Dad, I don't want to hurt people's feelings.++++@++++I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing.
We'd like some balsa wood, please.++++@++++Enough to build a Washington Monument.
What scale are you using?++++@++++What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
Washington Monument? Aren't you gonna even try?++++@++++What do you mean? And who are you?
I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying "I don't care. My kid's a loser."++++@++++But, you...
Hmm, that would be Westminster Abbey.++++@++++Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!
You won't get past the north transept!++++@++++Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions.
Blabby's gonna build an Abbey. Groovy.++++@++++But first, as part of "Operation Popularity," Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard.
Isn't this supposed to be my project?++++@++++All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.
Do you want me to watch and learn?++++@++++Naw, that kinda creeps me out.
Homer, don't give up till you finish my dear Abbey.++++@++++Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?
That's terrible advice.++++@++++Anne of Cleves!
Oh, and where is this delightful boy?++++@++++Oscar Wilde?
Homer, there are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.++++@++++But that makes no sense!
Experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes.++++@++++Shut up!
These days, man knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.++++@++++Whatever happened to "boo?"
Congratulations, son. At least you followed the rules.++++@++++Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!
Why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. In the words of Oscar Wilde: "Experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes." I saw him too, Dad.++++@++++I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
I'm sorry, Dad. These girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. I hope you understand.++++@++++Yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing I can do as a parent is simply check out.
No, there's a middle ground.++++@++++Lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off.
Not if you use a dimmer switch.++++@++++That's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
Well, I know a place in this house where you can really relax.++++@++++That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
No, I gave that to the homeless shelter.++++@++++It was stuffed with cash!
Feeling better, Super Dad?++++@++++Oh yeah.
Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm.++++@++++I can't understand that math reference, because I went to Springfield Elementary!
Wait, wait, wait. You're putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?++++@++++Oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! You're always gonna be friends with Milhouse. STAND BY ME / OH, STAND BY ME...
Ah, so cheap, eh?++++@++++Ahso sheepay to you.
No windows, no parking, and a man died here.++++@++++Yeah, um, well, I'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. Where's the bedroom?
Right here.++++@++++Tempting. Tempting. Where's the bathroom?
In the Ethiopian Restaurant at the end of the block.++++@++++I'll take it!
It's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. Some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.++++@++++Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.
Call it, friendo.++++@++++Heads. I mean, tails. I mean, on its side.
Well done. Now, let me validate your parking.++++@++++That's not enough.
It's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.++++@++++When do I get to move back home?
You just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. You can come home when the heat's off.++++@++++The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.
Please just stay there till Bart graduates high school.++++@++++That's another twenty or thirty years.
Brought you a housewarming present.++++@++++That was great. You mind if I use that at work?
Hey, are you into poker?++++@++++Well, I love to play, but I'm not very good. Also, I always forget to cash my chips back in for money.
This man-crush just got bro-mantic!++++@++++You make words into dudes.
She didn't even know who Alaska Nebraska was.++++@++++Your hair smells nice!
Definitely a cup.++++@++++Foam wasn't spilt in a day.
Does she have a sister?++++@++++Two, actually. Twins.
We don't need a bed. We're not gonna be sleeping.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
You know what a girl likes, mister. So, can I see you again?++++@++++How 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?
I love Tapas! It's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!++++@++++Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
And I've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment.++++@++++Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
Surprise! I redecorated!++++@++++Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!
You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make "us."++++@++++You know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife.
Wait! I want to ask you something.++++@++++What movie?
Where have you been? We have mirrors to hang!++++@++++I went to a movie.
Without me? How'd you get there?++++@++++I drove.
Without me?++++@++++Sometimes I think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
"Go Dog Go" with pages missing... Lego spaceship poorly assembled... Clearly, this is the home of elementary school children. Too bad. I was looking forward to killing you and making it look like a suicide.++++@++++Thank you, Friendo.
I am not your friendo.++++@++++But, I thought... you said...
Your comments when we watch movies aren't funny.++++@++++Why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
Please, I just want to go back to a place where I'm ostracized for being me, not for who I pretend to be.++++@++++What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've outgrown our first apartment.
Get a room!++++@++++C'mon, boy! Be cool!
I wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.++++@++++Well, I may be playing a tree but at least I'm getting my face out there.
I thought I was marrying a man who could play Macbeth.++++@++++Hey, there's no way I could ever be as good as that guy.
I think Mel would be happier as an understudy. A six-feet-understudy.++++@++++You're not suggesting... murder.
Wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would?"++++@++++Whatever you say, sweetie.
Snore. Snore.++++@++++A prop knife!
Out, out, brief candle! / Life's but a walking shadow...++++@++++He who laughs last, laughs dead.
That "crazy talk" is the work of the immortal Bard, William Shakespeare.++++@++++Well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks.
You don't even know your lines!++++@++++Conrad Birdie? Coming here to Sweet Apple?!
That's "Bye-Bye Birdie"!++++@++++"Dammit, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe."
Tonight the Springfield Community Playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... Dr. Hibbert as Banquo?!++++@++++Who the hell is Banquo?
He's the one getting the good reviews! Which makes him the next one you've got to kill.++++@++++Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?
Screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.++++@++++That's inspiring. What's that from? X-Men 2?
Macbeth!++++@++++Mac-who?
"In last night's 'Macbeth,' the best performance was Barney Gumbel as Duncan, followed by Duffman as MacDuff, Lenny Leonard as Lennox, Eddie and Lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, Homer Simpson."++++@++++Why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
All I heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. Unless you're not man enough.++++@++++No, dear. I'm a man, dear.
That's where you're wrong! Get out on that stage!++++@++++Ow!
Okay Homer, it's our last performance, you're the only actor that's still alive, and there's nobody in the audience -- this is your moment. I'll be in my office going over the books on my Subway sandwich franchise. You call a sandwich maker an artist, it's like an invitation to steal! A guy's goin' nani-nooni bananas in there!++++@++++It's my moment.
Henry The Fifth... Titus Andronicus...++++@++++Me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
Alright, Maggie. Today is parent-teacher day. So I want everyone to see how uncreative and beaten-down you've become. That's right, you're beaten-down. Yes, you are!++++@++++Goodbye, fat me.
Don't you lattÃ©-sipping leeches understand? I've seen enough of these Hollywood super-hunks -- we need a dumpy, unappealing loser -- an everyman!++++@++++Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar. Oh, I also need a dollar.
You... Are... Acceptable!++++@++++Great! Do you want to see me naked?
Oh, there's no nudity in this movie.++++@++++Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa?
Well, I qualified for the National Math Bee--++++@++++Great. Okay. Marge, go.
Guess who the garden club elected president?++++@++++You? Awesome. Next.
No. I lost.++++@++++Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart?
Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--++++@++++Time's up! Okay, Maggie: "suck, suck," that takes us to... me.
Homer, we have a problem.++++@++++Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.
We need you to slim down, muscle up and become the "Everyman" people want to be instead of the one they actually are.++++@++++I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: "Yo, hot dog man!" "Yo, peanuts!" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what "yo" means?
Maybe...I can help Lyle McCarthy.++++@++++Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do?
Here's what Brad and Angelina looked like before they met me.++++@++++Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones.
Homer, do you know why you eat?++++@++++Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.++++@++++Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate .
I'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. We don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song "Eye of the Tiger."++++@++++Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's "Heroes?"
Yeah, it's your montage.++++@++++This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?
I gotta take this. Tobey! Cider house rules! Total wuss. Seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? I hate this guy. I love this guy! Tobe, Tobe, Tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! Look, I gotta bail, I'm with Everyman right now. No, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! I'm only lying to him. Goodbye! Bad-bye.++++@++++Was that Tobey Maguire?
And sexy! Heroic! Sexy! Heroic! And sexy! Heroic! Earn that money!++++@++++Found this on the roof.
And cut!++++@++++What'd you think, kids?
What was that?!++++@++++Your other hand.
Oscar! Take a shower! Or a tomato bath, or something. Please!++++@++++This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends.
I'm being paid to do what I love!++++@++++A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.
Homer? Homer Sapian! Can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but I'm leaving for another gig.++++@++++Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
Just remember what I taught you.++++@++++But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
I have taught you well. Goodbye!++++@++++He's gone.
Avery, I swear, you're the only man in Gothamopolis who's never seen Everyman.++++@++++Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman.
I think you may have put on a little weight.++++@++++Nag, nag, nag.
Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.++++@++++Uh-oh.
Everyman! Show yourssself!++++@++++I'm right here! I've been here all along!
What happened, dude? You went from Everyman to Everywhereman.++++@++++What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it.
Okay. It was Turtle from "Entourage."++++@++++I knew it!
It's how I make my money.++++@++++Just you and me?
You, me and Turtle.++++@++++That could work.
He is a great guy. He's an awful guy.++++@++++You just said both those things to me.
Though legislation was passed to insure Everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. Or just hoping to see bad people beaten up.++++@++++I'm so cold.
Yes. Just one: relax. You're clearly a caring father.++++@++++You're the first teacher that ever got me.
Dad... am I bad on the inside?++++@++++No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?++++@++++When you say "teacher," do you really mean "parent?"
No, I mean teacher.++++@++++Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion.
What discussion?++++@++++The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! Ohhh.
Thanks for bringing me here, Dad. I'll remember this day on my deathbed.++++@++++Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly.
Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.++++@++++Maybe.
Stupid Romans.++++@++++Ask him.
Sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?++++@++++Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone.
Sure, no problem. Twenty-five dollars, please.++++@++++Pay the man, boy.
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!++++@++++Kill! Kill. Kill.
Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!++++@++++Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right.
Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!++++@++++It wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!
Glad you didn't come cheap.++++@++++I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!
One, two / We say boo! / Three, four / Stop the gore!++++@++++Five, six / Who's got tix?
Mom, you can't fight that guy.++++@++++Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block.
Thank you, Homie.++++@++++Listen: of all the crazy things I've ever done, this is the craziest. And you're doing it.
Or kick the crap out of you.++++@++++Watch your language, moron.
Someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. This goes against every feminist bone in my body, but Dad, can't you control your woman?++++@++++How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!
I know the woman I loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense.++++@++++We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?
What? You think just 'cause I'm black I know all other black people?++++@++++Well, I... uh...
"Beat, Slay, Shove."++++@++++I'll bash him with this book!
There must be a better way.++++@++++There certainly is.
Well let's go, "Marge." My class reunion starts in an hour.++++@++++Uh, Moe, I have a confession to make: I'm just Homer dressed as Marge.
Yeah, but last year I took Barney dressed as Marge. Think how much better they'll think you look.++++@++++Well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night.
Two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.++++@++++Ooo, ooo, can I go, Marge? Can I? Can I?
No. Let's go home. We can enjoy some mixed "marital" arts.++++@++++No holds barred.
We start with Grade A beef, feed that to other cows, then kill them and serve the unholy results on a seven-grain bun. Burger Squared!++++@++++The math checks out!
The munchers got Moe!++++@++++Well, we're not going out to help him. We have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!
Please let me in!++++@++++How do I know you're not a muncher?
I'm your father and I need your help!++++@++++I can't make sense of that muncher talk!
Dad, no! That's the last book in the world!++++@++++Really?
Oh my God. If Bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!++++@++++Then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
You must get him immediately to the safe zone, just outside of town. And if you see my wife... tell her I love her.++++@++++You mean tell her I love her? Or I meaning you?
We don't have a panic room!++++@++++To the panic room store!
Come with me if you want to live.++++@++++Another politician who can't keep his promises.
This way!++++@++++Well, this day can't get any crazier.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.++++@++++Well, well, well.
Dad, are you becoming a muncher?++++@++++I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?
Where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?++++@++++Ooo, mouth.
JUST ONCE I WISH CUPID / WOULD DRAW BACK HIS BOW / AND SHOOT ME A CUTIE / WHOSE STANDARDS ARE LOW...++++@++++Woo hoo! An unattended tap! Like takin' beer from a baby!
He what?!++++@++++Helllp me!
That uh, that's me. I've been taking ventriloquism lessons.++++@++++Help me or kill me!
Read on. It gets gayer.++++@++++WHILE TURNING GAY THE OTHER DAY / A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME...
I/YOU COULD DO...++++@++++SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO WORSE!
Homer?! Does this mean you still love me?++++@++++Of course I do, Marge. Can you still love a man who's half-beer?
I always have.++++@++++To love!
Definitely hands-off. He didn't mind if we punched in a little late, or not at all...++++@++++Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
Ah, I expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor.++++@++++Can't we just all supervise ourselves?
The nitwits are runnin' the goofhouse!++++@++++Yeah!
And the first beer's on me.++++@++++You see, he hasn't changed!
That'll do, Homer.++++@++++...to a "p". Spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks.
He had to have part of his tongue removed. That's real funny.++++@++++Oh, well... I didn't know that.
Great safety report, Homer -- no meltdowns all week. I'm making you my new executive assistant.++++@++++Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?
And call.++++@++++Nooooooo!
Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages.++++@++++Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
Who am I kidding?++++@++++Marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?
Tomorrow, my love.++++@++++Stupid Carl... "Update the phone list, Homer!" "You put my contact lenses in backwards, Homer!" I'm sorry, honey.
Book me a massage.++++@++++Leave me alone, you two!
Garden view?++++@++++Ocean view, obstructed.
NUZZLE... NECK. With pleasure!++++@++++Lemme try.
Why don't you just roll me?++++@++++We're gonna be snore in the morning...
Dammit, why won't you touch me?++++@++++Okay. Kiss me, baby! Kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!
Last night was the making it up to me! The most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!++++@++++Actually, those were Carl's shirts.
I can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.++++@++++Hey, it's not like I want to go. Go, go, go!
You know Homer, when I was your age, it was the future, "cause I'm younger than you. Just something to think about.++++@++++I will! Edamame?
Thank you, um...++++@++++French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme.
When we get back to the hotel, I want you to extend our stay... indefinitely.++++@++++But I have to get back to Marge.
Homer, there is a moth in my room! Where are you!?++++@++++Where I should've been all along...
What?! Homer! Return to the immortal City of Light at once! Or you're fired!++++@++++Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing "hide the baguette" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni!
Homie, you're back!++++@++++Hey Ned.
Boy, that was worth the wait.++++@++++Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?
Dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on Sunday?++++@++++Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out--
Bonk it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it!++++@++++I can't take it anymore!
Bonk-bonk-BONK it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it! Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it Bonk it! Bop it! Twist it! Smack it! Thwack it! Whack it!++++@++++It's daddy's turn!
Bonk it! Bonk it. Bonnnnk it...++++@++++Finally, some peace and quiet.
Oh don't worry, we don't kill it. We just dip it.++++@++++What happened?
What happened is, I saved your life. Now you's had a rough day. Why'n'tcha have a pull on this?++++@++++Where's the hooch?
This here's my pride and joy: 'Ol Betsy.++++@++++A female that gives birth to alcohol.
What's your take, city boy?++++@++++Well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. And I detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game.
Things said in the circle have a surprising way of coming true.++++@++++Lisa! Lisa!
Text your Mom to pick us up.++++@++++Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help!
You said you were at a parenting class!++++@++++Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob.
That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.++++@++++Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
Well, I think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in Lisa's life is which boy will marry her. Right, Homer? Homer?++++@++++Start the ride!
Now, we've seen how cookies crumble and soda gets its pop, so let's take a close up look at America's favorite drop -- the gumdrop!++++@++++Oooh.
In Outstanding Lighting Direction Electronic Multi-Camera for Variety, Music or Comedy Programming, we have... a three-way tie!++++@++++Back to the horses! Back to the horses!
Global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.++++@++++I see. So you're saying "warming" makes it colder. Well, aren't you the Queen of Crazyland? Everything's the opposite of everything. La-de-da-de-da! I'm Lisa Simpson. La-de-da-de-da.
Dad... I want a baby brother.++++@++++Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out.
Lisa got a sister! Why can't you have another boy?++++@++++Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know.
You never told me how my body works.++++@++++Point and shoot.
Bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.++++@++++You had me at "five-course," you lost me at "romantic," and you got me back at "dinner."
Oh what a lovely evening.++++@++++And it's not over yet.
Maybe we could do both.++++@++++Yeah!
Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player.++++@++++Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time.
The Yawning Monkey? "The Pair Of Tongs?"++++@++++Ooo, look! "Congress Of The Crow!"
Okay!++++@++++All right, all right, um, your ankle goes there...
Uh-huh, and now hand me your neck...++++@++++And turn that upside down...
Mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...++++@++++...don't look at that...
Oh, Barty, I'm sorry. But your father and I think that three kids is just perfect.++++@++++Holy moly!
You're gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.++++@++++Well, welcome, Charlie! Nice to meet ya! No glasses -- way to go! This one's a keeper!
So many sisters... save me, Bart!++++@++++I know you miss him, boy. So let's you and me spend some quality father and son time.
Sounded like I said naked bacon.++++@++++Did somebody say "naked bacon?"
See. We all thought it was naked--++++@++++Yeah. It sounded like naked bacon to me. I don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, Tom.
But if you--++++@++++No, you said "naked bacon."
Well, I'll tell you, you may both agree, but folksingers never say take it naked bacon.++++@++++Do you guys know Funky Town?
In one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular!++++@++++Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!
You know, I did sit on a shark once...++++@++++Dad, bathing suit!
Let's give a wet and wacky welcome to Springfield's oldest performing mollusk...++++@++++Get to the show!
Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.++++@++++Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
Seen the paper?++++@++++No, I get my news off the internet.
Well, sir, it looks like your Dad is a quotable notable.++++@++++It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
...Clark Gable owes me a book. And he never paid me for the shoeshine. But his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. Lunch butter we called it.++++@++++How come Grampa never shares those stories with us?
He does all the time. You just never listen.++++@++++Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place.
Ooh, I like this kid.++++@++++Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get.
This man's more of a son to me than you've ever been.++++@++++What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been.
I don't think that's true.++++@++++Stay out of this, Dad!
You only care about me now because I'm famous!++++@++++That's it! Here's your ring back.
Ring? What ring?++++@++++It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!
This isn't Larry. It's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! Where's the real Larry?++++@++++Drop that pillow!
And if this is Homer, you're too late for my love!++++@++++Stupid Grampa. I try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa. Maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.++++@++++Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch.
... and that's how you win an opium war!++++@++++Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?...
The Yangtze River swallows all secrets.++++@++++Hmm... I'm just gonna put "haste makes waste."
Release... a hound.++++@++++Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.
HERE COMES THE PRIZE / PULITZER PRIZE / I'LL FINALLY BE SUCCESSFUL / IN MY MOTHER'S EYES++++@++++A little lower... a little lower...
Well, at least you never tried to kill me.++++@++++Just with indifference.
I sure did. But why don't we let Homer tell the story.++++@++++Really? Me? You mean it?
I think you're ready for your first ramble.++++@++++I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?
I'm hangin' on every word.++++@++++Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name "The Rolling Stones." The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen.
Time to try out my new deep fryer.++++@++++...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
I don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.++++@++++Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head.
Hey, don't listen to me! What do I know about rainbows?!++++@++++None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits...
I'm afraid your daily donuts are no more.++++@++++You... can't... do that...
Easy there, habitrail.++++@++++They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!
I'm a corporate recruiter who specializes in nuclear workers.++++@++++I guess these days headhunters can be anything.
The Krusty Show sucks now. It's all pink and princessy. Why are great things always ruined by women? The Army... the Fantastic Four... think how awesome American Idol would be with just Simon and Randy!++++@++++Oh Bart, you say that now. But when you're grown up, you'll just think it. Now you stay here and I'll get your sister.
You got it, Gator.++++@++++Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!
Oh, I imagine Cap City's been wooing you with trips to the seashore, a Christmas goose, Spanish lemons... folderol I can't afford to match. But please, accept this little going away present.++++@++++You can't win us back with mere donuts.
Oh, but these aren't just any donuts. These donuts were made the old-fashioned way: the dough is sweetened with Cuban sugar from pre-Batista plantations, then it's deep fried in the tallow of three different animals, two of which are now extinct.++++@++++That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.
YOU LIKE POTATO...++++@++++AND YOU LIKE POTATO...
YOU LIKE TOMATO...++++@++++AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
potato!++++@++++potato!
TOMATO!++++@++++TOMATO!
AND TOAST... VALERIE AND DAAAAAVE!++++@++++TOGASAKI-ROTHMAN!
Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?++++@++++Songwriters who are stuck!
Homie, I'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people...++++@++++Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride.
Homer's got a girlfriend!++++@++++She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend.
Mine says "Something you lost will soon turn up." My faith in the Lord -- it came back!++++@++++"Today is your lucky day." Yeah, pfft!
If it's your lucky day, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.++++@++++Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--
Thank you, come again. Who's next? Hello++++@++++...Yo no creÃ­a en fortunas, pero entonces me saliÃ³ una galleta...
SÃ­, sÃ­...++++@++++...que decÃ­a que hoy era mi dÃ­a dichoso. Primero no lo creÃ­, pero entonces me caÃ­ contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!
Homer! Where are you?++++@++++I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...
/ / /++++@++++Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little...
Good evening, Mr. Homer, how can I--++++@++++No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!
Oh thank God you're okay!++++@++++I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...
Seven-oh-seven? That's exactly the moment I was furious at you for missing our toast. And now I'm the one who has to ask... Can you forgive me?++++@++++I'll try.
Wait a minute, Homer! You can't spend any of that money or Marge will know you lied.++++@++++Oh yeah.
The laundry. The machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it.++++@++++Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me.
Why don't you just buy things your family needs, and leave them where they'll find them?++++@++++Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree.
That's not the money tree.++++@++++I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
You threw it, you go find it.++++@++++Why you little...
Ow! There's a big box in here!++++@++++A box? No way!
That's just what we need! But how are we going to get it home?++++@++++You go rent us a truck.
There's money in this tree. What the hell is going on?++++@++++Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer...
Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?++++@++++Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born.
Look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot.++++@++++You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?
Don't forget my cut.++++@++++Um... your cut of what?
So... where you from, Homer?++++@++++Here.
Yeah. Come on up. You can play the tambourine.++++@++++I said someone like me, I didn't say me.
Here we go, folks -- the ultimate zero-gravity experience!++++@++++Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!
No way! I wanna go a million more times!++++@++++Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.
Rich kids don't need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super.++++@++++With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!
Oh yeah? If you don't keep splashing the cash, I'm gonna tell Mom that it's thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever.++++@++++Blackmail your father in space, will you?!
I'm not a dude, I'm a hottie!++++@++++Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?
Oh great, now that Dad's gonna star in it.++++@++++I agreed to no such thing!
Mo-om...++++@++++Where and what time?
Homeroom, eight a.m.++++@++++Never!
Homer! I need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!++++@++++Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
Hey, hey, hey. Let's not get crazy. If you quit, I'm telling Mom everything.++++@++++Not if I tell her first.
Okay, but just 'cause I'm your best friend, don't be afraid to use that whip.++++@++++Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold...
Well, I kind of got a clue when I heard that "ballooning safety" video.++++@++++Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess. Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast because... I was buying a lottery ticket.
You were what?!++++@++++You have a right to be angry. Furious! And even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
We've got a million dollars?! Screw the toast!++++@++++Uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... I spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon...
So we're right back where we used to be.++++@++++Yes, but I have one more thing to show you.
Homer, you don't look fat.++++@++++Carl, you're a liar, but I love it.
Don't leave until you find that leak!++++@++++Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night.
We're appalling!++++@++++I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic.
Really? How romantic?++++@++++It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
It's so noisy in here! I can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!++++@++++Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie.
This isn't fair! I want romance!++++@++++How about bromance?
It's not the same.++++@++++Dude...
A sport that encourages hand-holding.++++@++++Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
Sorry, no skating tonight.++++@++++What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers.
...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.++++@++++Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!
Maybe you'd like to give it a try?++++@++++Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!
Yeah, like the time you said Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?++++@++++Curling is real.
Hey, look who "slid" into our "house."++++@++++Great curling reference.
Astonishing news out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin: the Olympic Committee has announced that Mixed Curling will be a Demonstration Event at the Winter Olympics!++++@++++There's a Winter Olympics?
Homer, while you were imagining what the Winter Olympics were, Seymour said we were all going to the Olympic trials!++++@++++Olympic trials, eh?
Homie! We're going to Vancouver!++++@++++Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!
Homer, who's that?++++@++++She used to be my therapist.
Pay your bill!++++@++++I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!
Hoo-hoo!++++@++++OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!
Well, Homer's my soul mate! And you don't dump a soul mate!++++@++++Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?
Well, no matter what you do, it won't make up for Sir Slip-a-lot over there.++++@++++Uh-oh.
This is the sort of bittersweet melodrama Olympic coverage feeds on! I admit it! We're vampires who suck on shattered dreams!++++@++++That's my Marge! High-five!
Sorry, but I'm afraid she'll never curl again.++++@++++It's stuck!
I'm not horny, I'm mad.++++@++++Ooo, you're mad when you're angry...
Let's give the Olympics a miracle!++++@++++But this time, on ice!
The U.S.A. has won Demonstration Gold. Our first and only medals of these entire Olympics. Kids, open your history books, tear out the pages and put this indelible Olympic moment in!++++@++++U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
They're all horrible!++++@++++Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few...
Not a one! Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner...++++@++++Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.
This entry's dated April 14th, 1860.++++@++++I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud.
I can't believe we're descended from slave owners!++++@++++Me neither. For once, the Simpsons were in management!
Then they should've called it the "Above-Ground Normal-Road."++++@++++Good point, Bart.
Very good, Bart.++++@++++That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there.
What are you doing? I wanna know what happens next.++++@++++Well I don't. The motto of the Simpsons is, "quit while you're ahead."
But-but-but-but-but...++++@++++Time for bed, sweetie.
Ooh, good idea. Bart, what are you doing for Black History Month?++++@++++I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
To the reference desk!++++@++++The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?
You're a liar!++++@++++Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!
I'll take that secret to my grave! Or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!++++@++++Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you.
Okay, I'll talk! D-Day is June 6th! Repeat: June 6th! Allied forces will land on the beaches of Normandy in the following order: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno... are you writing this down, Fritz?++++@++++About Virgil.
That's why my jazz is so smooth!++++@++++And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!
I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?++++@++++So that's why I love drinking so much.
I'm French, not you.++++@++++C'est la vie, baby.
I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?++++@++++A little!
One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.++++@++++I say this boy needs more homework.
Thanks for doing the dishes.++++@++++No problem. You can unload.
Y'know -- I think Bart might have too much homework. If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever.++++@++++Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.
Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?++++@++++Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
Dear Lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that I am right as usual.++++@++++Too late, Marge. I already used a "prayer block" on your prayer.
There's no such thing as prayer blocks!++++@++++Yeah, right.
The violence really relaxes me.++++@++++You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
Don't contradict me in front of our son!++++@++++Well don't be wrong in front of our son!
Let's have lunch at "Crouching Tiger Hidden Eggroll."++++@++++No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.
Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.++++@++++What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!
The last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!++++@++++That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!
Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!++++@++++Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
You practiced all day on my birthday!++++@++++Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!
You were never going to apologize!++++@++++I was too! The words were in my brain!
I don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!++++@++++No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!
Well then there won't be any sex!++++@++++You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!
I'm sorry we ever fought.++++@++++We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.
Till the two of us are back on track, Bart can fend for himself.++++@++++Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.
Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say...++++@++++Whatever. Knock yourself out.
Really? Okay.++++@++++Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh...
Oh my God, Homie -- we're having a real conversation!++++@++++Yeah.
You won't believe how I got home.++++@++++Don't know, don't care.
Thanks, Dad. But you're so loud it's hurting my ears.++++@++++Sorry!
And there's a map of the subway system attached. Homer, we've got to stop him!++++@++++But Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage.
We're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.++++@++++Fine. I'll do both at once. We should both take a role in vacation planning!
Mister, you are grounded!++++@++++And no TV!
And I'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!++++@++++And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out.
Turn right in... fifty meters.++++@++++Meters?
Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!++++@++++Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.
Turn right in two-point three kilometers...++++@++++Why you...
Anyway, I'm really hoping you could... Dad?++++@++++Hey boy.
But I need to talk about man stuff!++++@++++Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.
On the top of the slide.++++@++++That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
Mr. Simpson, I'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy.++++@++++Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
And we will make you regret the day your son was born.++++@++++You're halfway home, lady.
If I talk to Nikki, I'm sure I can--++++@++++No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.
And it means the world to me.++++@++++Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls.
This is awesome! If only real life was in 3-D.++++@++++And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
I'm Bart Simpson. Disruptive fourth-grader.++++@++++I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.
That's not Bart, it's Principal Skinner. Bart's sitting right next to you.++++@++++Yeah, now that I look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody.
Shut up, fatso.++++@++++Why you little...
Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: "Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"++++@++++Hey, my bathing suit came off!
...man I ever met!++++@++++Hold that thought.
I sense a "but" coming, Reverend...++++@++++Here comes the butt!
Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests.++++@++++Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?
Homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!++++@++++I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.
True enough.++++@++++A truckload of applesauce!
The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!++++@++++Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!
Homer, that's not why we're here. We can see the stations of the cross!++++@++++After we see the stations of the omelet bar.
Lord, please help Homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land.++++@++++He's going for the record! He's going for the record!
Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?++++@++++Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card.
Homer, could you at least turn the camera off?++++@++++If you say it like Dracula I will.
Bleh.++++@++++That is going right on stupidflanders.org.
Yes, but it means more to you.++++@++++Boy, are you lousy at reading minds.
Homer, quit playing that back.++++@++++I'm not, it's my ringtone.
Sad. Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt.++++@++++Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?
"Dear Lord, don't let Marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."++++@++++Why you little...
Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock.++++@++++I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior...
Unknown? This is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!++++@++++Porky Pig?
You come all the way to Jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!++++@++++Chickpea Fizz.
Delete! Delete! Delete!++++@++++Whatever. It's your camera.
Homer, do you know why I'm a Christian?++++@++++Your parents made you?
It's because I believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. At least I thought so till now. Homer Simpson, you are not worth saving.++++@++++What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...
This looks like a job for... the messiah!++++@++++THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...
You have been chosen, Homer.++++@++++Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?
Rise and listen, my child...yours is a great destiny.++++@++++Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato.
Oh Homie, you're alive!++++@++++I am more than alive, woman! I am the Chosen One who shall unite all the faiths of the Holy Land! I am... the messiah!
But you still have our passports, right?++++@++++Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.
Uh... Messiah... do you mind if I have a word with your wife?++++@++++As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins.
Hmm... Dad said he was going to "unite all faiths." And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!++++@++++The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!
I'm pushy?! Please. You stay there surrounded by your great enemy, Canada. Try Syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy.++++@++++Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews.
I did it! I reached him!++++@++++Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!
In a soup you can boil it!++++@++++Spread the word! Peace and chicken!
Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth.++++@++++Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in.
I'd like that.++++@++++How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?
You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.++++@++++They have malls on land?
...and so our Employee of the Month is the late Roger Ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. Moving on. The Power Plant's first annual Fourth of July picnic is this coming Saturday!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Burns -- what an ungrateful jerk! We hoofed our hearts out for him -- with no rehearsal!++++@++++I say Burns owes us a party. Let's have one, right now, with his wine!
That's a regular-sized bottle. I'm drinkin' Jeroboams.++++@++++I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
Homer, that's a sixty thousand dollar bottle!++++@++++Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!
Yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?++++@++++Yeah, you're right.
And just what might that be?++++@++++Uh... this is my lunch.
Really? Okay, eat your lunch.++++@++++But--
You said it's your lunch. Eat it.++++@++++Eat my lunch?
Yes! Enjoy!++++@++++Okay, I will!
They continued for some time in this vein, until...++++@++++You don't think I'm going to?
I don't see any chewing!++++@++++Okay.
Well the catch is, happy workers are productive workers.++++@++++There's always a catch.
It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill our ants.++++@++++Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!
Dad, before you jump to conclusions...++++@++++Please tell me they suffered.
To Mr. Smithers! / Hooray!++++@++++Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.
Yes, the service on my car was excellent. Five out of five. Four out of five. Five out of five. Um, excuse me, can I go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? I'm wasting your time?++++@++++Smithers. What a marshmallow.
You told me you did.++++@++++I do, but I'm not going to it.
You know, I used to wonder why Mr. Burns hated humanity. Now I know. You open your heart and they mock your very decency!++++@++++Ooh! We mock your very decency.
Man, Smithers is workin' us like dogs!++++@++++Well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation.
Instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!++++@++++I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back.
Yeah. And they've replaced parking meters with this thing you stick your credit card into.++++@++++The war is over and the future won. The past never had a chance, man!
Homer Simpson, for causing a panic in the bank, you are hereby sentenced to one hundred hours of community service.++++@++++Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?
Community service!++++@++++No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu!
Hey, whatcha packin', Simpson?++++@++++Just my lunch.
My wife only parms on my birthday. And that's only if I give her the sad puppy-dog look.++++@++++Awwww, want a bite?
Throw a jean jacket on top of these babies and you can go anywhere.++++@++++From fast food to fine dining?
Ever stop breathing when you're asleep?++++@++++Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.
Overweight? You? Oh now that's crazy. Now me, I have to get my underwear specially made by this village in the Ukraine. They call me "Daddy Round-Round." Send me a Christmas card every year.++++@++++That's some big underwear.
Uh Simpson, hold on a sec. Um... You wanna uh... Uh, I don't know, get a beer sometime, uh...++++@++++Okay. Ever been to Moe's?
Uh, Earth to Homer -- I arrested you there last month.++++@++++Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it.
Aw, now, who could blame you? Your sports team lost. Yeah. Well I'll see you at Moe's.++++@++++I'm there every day, five to eleven.
Yeah, and you can feel good about eating here too, because all the cooks are ex-cons getting a second chance.++++@++++Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work.
No you won't. Follow me.++++@++++Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
Hey Homer, hand me my coffee.++++@++++Want some sugar?
No, no, I got it.++++@++++Impressive.
G'ahead.++++@++++Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little "spring cleaning?"
Listen Homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?++++@++++Really? Me?
Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me.++++@++++Chief... me too.
Ever worry the sun's not going to come back after it goes down at night?++++@++++No...
Uh, me neither. But, but you know who does? Ralphie. Got a lot of worries, that kid: What if the bed wets him? What if Superman decided to kill everybody?++++@++++Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad.
You see?++++@++++Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of...
Homer... what happened to me?++++@++++You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
You missed the wakeup. That's all that counts.++++@++++Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?
Now? But I just woke up.++++@++++Well, if you really want me to stay...
No, no. You do what you have to do. Live your life. Which I saved.++++@++++Fine! I'll stay a little more.
Homer, where you been the last few weeks?++++@++++Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.
Well, well, well. So this is the "Saint Elmo's Fire" reunion that Andrew McCarthy himself was going to attend.++++@++++Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... "I'm hungry," "I'm itchy," "that's not my blood type..."
World's worst friend.++++@++++Hey man, you planted that!
You mugs'll never take me alive, see.++++@++++Everything.
Any idea where he might be?++++@++++I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.
I'm sorry, Homer. If I hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk.++++@++++Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life.
Well, at least we got to be friends again -- y'know, before we got whacked.++++@++++We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this.
You have that much faith in me?++++@++++No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real.
Well said, Lou. Oh Homer, you want to take out the police copter and hassle people with the spotlight?++++@++++I know just the guy.
Hot cocoa?++++@++++No, ice cold.
/ What's going on?++++@++++Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
Dad, while I agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle.++++@++++Are you calling me fat?
No... I am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy.++++@++++Hmm... Alternative Energy Expo. Where there's expos, there's free Frisbees! Let's roll. But we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out.
Solar power is a bright idea!++++@++++Yeah, so is getting a real job.
Dad! I found what you're looking for!++++@++++A churro you can eat in the shower?
Goddag, friendlys! Behold to you -- wind! The energy that powers Denmark.++++@++++Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?
Well, there are tax credits, government rebates... it will pay for itself in twelve to eighteen...++++@++++Months?
Lifetimes.++++@++++Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal.
Lars, get the twine! You will not regret this!++++@++++I'm starting to regret it already.
Dad, you are leading the way in clean energy.++++@++++Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?
It's making our meter run backwards!++++@++++Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
Dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company.++++@++++Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!
We will cancel your account, sir.++++@++++The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
O'er the ramparts we what?!++++@++++Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!
Dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still.++++@++++Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently.
My smoothie is a lumpy!++++@++++The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang.
Homer, this meeting of your "fan club" is adjourned!++++@++++But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
Kent's Weather Worriers are reporting gusts up to seventy-five...++++@++++Now we're cookin' with wind!
Homie, maybe this is too much electricity.++++@++++Nothing is ever right for you.
We're gonna go check out the wind damage!++++@++++Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation.
Our wedding china's ruined.++++@++++We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
Hey, Mom... Dad... there's a whale on the beach... You've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!++++@++++All right -- let me get my tool belt.
Homie, can I talk to you for a second?++++@++++Sure. Lisa, bring the car around.
But I don't know how to drive.++++@++++Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?
We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.++++@++++Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison.
Lisa is very sensitive. If something she loves dies in front of her--++++@++++That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself.
It's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.++++@++++One, two, three, tug!
Operation Desert Ocean is a go! Let's get this lady fish into the blue zone!++++@++++It was my idea to put the whale in the water.
She doesn't like lying on the beach! She likes being in the ocean!++++@++++Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect.
Not perfect?! You can say that again.++++@++++I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?
Maybe I should just be alone a little bit.++++@++++Of course.
Bluella?++++@++++Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!
Those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. I guess it's just nature's way.++++@++++Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!
Dad? Where did you get that boat?++++@++++I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!
Drop the 'poon!++++@++++Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!
Did you know that over forty million sharks are slaughtered every year to make shark-fin soup?++++@++++You like sharks?
Linda, please.++++@++++Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
They're right. If the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, I can't let you do it.++++@++++Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder...
Dad! The sharks must think you're a baby whale!++++@++++Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working.
It's the baby whales' dad!++++@++++Thanks, buddy!
Thanks for not letting me give up, Dad.++++@++++Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which I mean you.
Do you think they'll be okay?++++@++++Absolutely. He's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. They'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. But if I'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way.
Now, who wants...beer cozies! A shirt that says "Yo!" Sassy seat cushions! And Flash drives for your P.C. so you can take your data and back it up!!!++++@++++I want some of that!
No. I won't.++++@++++Keep guessing...
Ooh. That's a Bingo.++++@++++Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.
I've had better. Down at the train station.++++@++++I'll have to check it out sometime.
Now the best mac and cheese I've ever had is at a bowling alley in Ogdenville.++++@++++I am pretty full.
Breadcrumbs on the top.++++@++++I'm on my way!
Partly sunny!++++@++++Golf ball-sized hail!
A chance of severe thunder storms with golf ball-sized hail!++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Mm-hmm! Now I'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. Tsk, tsk, tsk.++++@++++/
Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!++++@++++Hey boy, whatcha doing?
Experimenting with my butt.++++@++++My little Einstein.
Homer, Maggie has to wear that clown mask for Halloween. What's going on?++++@++++Well, uh... The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?
I don't see what's so wonderful.++++@++++Remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? Well, now I can afford a motorcycle!
De-meat those feet!++++@++++Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!
But you promised!++++@++++Later. Later.
This used to be just a little part of me.++++@++++You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil.
I guess I did create this... like God created the devil.++++@++++God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool.
I never wanted to turn into Big Brother. I just wanted to be Little Sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place.++++@++++Well, if you ask me, you were trying to play God.
That's the worst sin of all for some reason! What can I do to make things right?++++@++++You can help me take out those cameras.
One of our wives is leaving us for Moe?!++++@++++Moe's leaving town?!
You guys should go on that cruise. You'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father...++++@++++I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach.
And I can spend my Mother's Day taking care of something I've been putting off for a long time.++++@++++Cleaning the gutters?
That's something you've been putting off.++++@++++Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!
Why do I waste my breath?++++@++++Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now.
Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by "taking care of something?"++++@++++Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything.
Dad! That's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.++++@++++I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing.
No battery?!++++@++++I got Marge!
Homer? I'm-- you!++++@++++You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
We're breaking up!++++@++++Aw dammit!
I'm, uh, I'm sure you do.++++@++++Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore.
Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.++++@++++Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them.
Sorry Homer, I ain't servin' no liquor. Just "O'Glums" non-alcohol beer.++++@++++Marge, this is crazy!
Knock-a-doodle-you!++++@++++Flanders?!
Take our picture.++++@++++All right.
I wasn't smiling!++++@++++What the--
I had something in my teeth.++++@++++Why you--
My eyes were shut.++++@++++Lousy--
Except setting off car alarms with his big fat footsteps.++++@++++You take that back!
...oh, man do I make the soup. My goodness do I make the soup.++++@++++I'm doomed.
Hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. I know no more.++++@++++Uh... I do.
You do?! Tell me!++++@++++I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self...
Then what happened?++++@++++I don't know.
Well, how can you be so sure your wife is not the putty in the bartender's hands?++++@++++Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?
Well... I... uh...++++@++++The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.
I'm still mad at you from last night.++++@++++Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous.
Here it comes. The moment of truth.++++@++++She's packing her bag!
So it is you, Mr. Homer. But let's be honest -- a woman of her age married to a man of-- how old are you? Sixty-five?++++@++++Thirty-nine.
What do you think?++++@++++You're not leaving me?
It's that Patty and Selma. There's something evil about them. Did you know they smoked when I was pregnant?++++@++++Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me.
And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.++++@++++Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both.
Homie, slow down!++++@++++Why should I? The city's broke! They can't afford to enforce their precious laws!
Oh come on. What kind of big fat moron would fall for...++++@++++Cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
Sorry, someone else has bought the house.++++@++++But my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!
Side-what-whom?++++@++++Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be.
A lot of people sound like Sideshow Bob, like Frasier on "Cheers."++++@++++Or Frasier on "Frasier."
Sideshow Bob!++++@++++Stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette.
Good. That'll give me something to do while you're at the game.++++@++++Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.
I'll prove I'm telling the truth! Bob has huge feet, right? Well, look!++++@++++It's like you're a Chinese empress!
I'm not a writer.++++@++++And I'm not a locksmith!
Yeah I've seen him. He... uh... said he was driving down to Mexico.++++@++++Mexico! AndalÃ©! AndalÃ©! Arriba!
Hey! Hey no!++++@++++Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!
Si?++++@++++Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?
Taco.++++@++++Yes, that's exactly the word I want to translate.
Homer, can we please find Bart?++++@++++Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it.
Glad to say it, and now the girls will "yay" it!++++@++++Stop! Stop! Stop!
So, do we have a winner?++++@++++Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
I think I've come up with the answer.++++@++++Oh my God.
Just call me Barf Simpson.++++@++++I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you.
Dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?++++@++++But if we win this, we get a gift certificate.
You're home early!++++@++++Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--
Moe's is closed, huh?++++@++++Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?
We can enjoy each others' company.++++@++++Okay.
I didn't see you come in.++++@++++Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner.
That's nice. What kind of favor?++++@++++I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...
Good day to you.++++@++++Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar.
What was the greatest X.F.L. team that never won a championship?++++@++++Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?
Homie! I thought you were at that sports bar.++++@++++Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went.
Hooked for life...++++@++++Marge! You ruined my shot!
We're watching the Nobel Prize announcements, live from Stockholm!++++@++++Oooh, the Nobies!
Huzzah! I had him in the pool!++++@++++Lucky.
Quiet! It's time for the noblest Nobel Prize of all: the Peace Prize.++++@++++I would kill for that.
All right, all right, settle down. Homer, you're the easiest laugh I know.++++@++++How easy am I?
Shut up. I'm gonna need you in the audience when I accept the Peace Prize in Oslo.++++@++++Can my son come too? He knows what to do when I swallow my tongue.
THEY FIGHT AND BITE / THEY FIGHT! AND BITE AND FIGHT / FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! / BITE! BITE! BITE! / THE ITCHY AND SCRATCHY SHOW!++++@++++They fight and bite? I never go to Europe without learning something.
How 'bout that airline food, huh?! They should've called it chicken cordon blecch!++++@++++Another good one...
You are NOT in Oslo. You are in Holland... specifically, The Hague!++++@++++Did you say a Hague?
We don't put "Euro" in front of everything. Euro-guards! Take him away in Euro-cuffs!++++@++++Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.
Is it Region One or Region Two?++++@++++Uh, what region is America?
Region One.++++@++++Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!
First we're visiting Grampa.++++@++++No fair! We just went to church!
I just want to see the look on your faces when I share with you the fruits of a lifetime of labor.++++@++++Fifty bucks each?! That's your life savings?!
Is that the cat in there?!++++@++++Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat.
Don't worry, Homer -- I'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow.++++@++++You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town.
You know, a much nicer table just opened up!++++@++++After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made.
You go ahead, I'll stay here. If I get something on this handbag, I won't be able to return it.++++@++++Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- Wiggum's making his move!
Homer! Take me home!++++@++++Sure, sure!
I'd like to return this handbag. Unused.++++@++++I believe this stranger!
Well, here's your refund.++++@++++Check and mate.
Thank God! I will never do that again.++++@++++Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?
Homie, you know what happens when you push your luck...++++@++++Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!
Did you find a mouse head in your Cuppa-Soup?++++@++++I wish. What the hell are you doing?!
With this protective plastic overlay, I can't tell if I'm watching an old "Seinfeld" or an old "Old Christine."++++@++++Now, everyone onto the hot tub.
Sir, this suitcase has an airline tag on it, these ping-pong balls have been served and volleyed, and this hot plate's still warm.++++@++++Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.
I'm Chris Hansen from "To Catch A Credit-Whore". We know you've been returning used items all over town.++++@++++It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um...
People like you?++++@++++Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!
Anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!++++@++++Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?
Homie, maybe you could do it.++++@++++Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased.
You know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them.++++@++++That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy.
Here's my uniform, since I won't be needing it any more!++++@++++Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!
Cut it out! You're upsetting the gravy boat!++++@++++I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
Lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? Fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever.++++@++++Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!
What about Bart's feelings?++++@++++Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles.
Why do you say such ridiculous things?++++@++++They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally.
Brother Bear said "Sister Bear is inconsiderate."++++@++++...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
It's the most exciting play in baseball! Go, Bart!++++@++++If he makes it, that's my son!
The Isotots lose! Now to begin my off-season job: follow-home robberies. I'll see you in the parking lot, but you won't see me, until it's too late.++++@++++You stink!
Oh Homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters.++++@++++Yeah, charts are for squares, baby.
Homie, help him up!++++@++++Fine, I'll get the hook.
He's nothing but hard bronze muscle.++++@++++O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know...
I'm not really in the mood anymore.++++@++++Fine. I'm going for a walk.
Poor man. You've been through so much.++++@++++Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses.
God, it was horrible!++++@++++Marge, can I have a word with you in private?
That is so sweet!++++@++++Why do pie makers get all the girls?
No it wasn't!++++@++++Well, it was rhubarb.
No, it was berry-peach!++++@++++Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!
The pie was poisoned. You were right! I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.++++@++++Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!
What do you mean, this one?++++@++++Never mind.
Oh Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?++++@++++Ooh, got a text.
Dear God. We just killed a man.++++@++++Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea.
Roger was telling the truth!++++@++++This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!
Low sodium!++++@++++Then... his story was true!
Well, if it isn't my saviors.++++@++++Hey pal, how ya been?
Don't you "pal" me. Why did you try to kill me?!++++@++++The pie you baked us killed that shark!
Yes, I suspected our host would poison us, so I gave everyone an antidote before dinner.++++@++++Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
We'll know.++++@++++Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!
I can't live with the guilt.++++@++++She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!
Edmund's almost here, so PLEASE nobody be themselves!++++@++++I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow.
Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked.++++@++++I get the drumstick!
There they are!++++@++++Super-Team -- fly!
I'm Dracula, not The Hulk.++++@++++Hyah! Hyah!
Too late. The bloodlust is upon me.++++@++++Back off, you unholy dreamboat!
Yes, but at least you are safe, my son.++++@++++Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?
His blood! It's full of cholesterol!++++@++++And not the good kind!
Uh, Dad? They turned you into a vampire.++++@++++Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
Don'tcha want her beyond all reason?++++@++++Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions.
Dad, I think Maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing "Baby Must-Have."++++@++++No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!
Pick a box -- you get what you get.++++@++++You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
I can't give you another toy till you buy another ten gallons of gas.++++@++++You're lucky you're behind glass.
Ain't no glass.++++@++++Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!
You have a good day.++++@++++Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
Oh Homie, maybe we should call it a day.++++@++++Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!
Ooo, everything's changed! That tree used to be a smaller tree. And that food bank used to be a regular bank.++++@++++The march of progress.
Well, stop in and say "hi" to me 'cause I'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad.++++@++++Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
As long as I can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every Halloween.++++@++++Just don't dress me up like a woman.
Well, as long as we don't have to feed this one.++++@++++Tell her "no deal".
Dad, can I talk to you for a second?++++@++++What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?
Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you.++++@++++Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their "Homer."
No offense Dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams.++++@++++It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die.
That's odd. Lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.++++@++++Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night.
She doesn't want to end up like me?!++++@++++No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!
What's so wrong with me?++++@++++Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain.
I remember everything.++++@++++Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!
No. Just a picture of Lisa. Who wants to be nothing like me.++++@++++I am so sorry, Marge.
The seven of clubs.++++@++++Ta-da!
Mom, Dad! Please, can I go here? I'll study so hard I'll make the old me look like Bart.++++@++++That would be one weird-looking kid.
Mom, please don't.++++@++++Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the "I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years" look.
I have a future! Thank you, Mom!++++@++++Thank you, four-eyes!
Um, eight o'clock.++++@++++Thank you.
That school is so great! Teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. Is Mom gonna come up and say goodnight?++++@++++Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams.
I'm so glad you two are friends again.++++@++++Look what Maggie got!
Homer? How did you get...?++++@++++Up, a father has his secrets.
They have a vaccine!++++@++++All right. We'll get the vaccine.
Homer, did you know he was in the pile?++++@++++I thought he was an old clump of rags.
No. It's better that they hear it from me. I'll tell them the truth in the simplest way I know how.++++@++++Why did Burns make us all come here?
The truth is... I'm dying.++++@++++Hell yeah!
I hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes.++++@++++Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
Hm, apparently Mr. Burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent.++++@++++Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with.
Just because Mr. Burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless.++++@++++Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you.
This town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge.++++@++++Amen.
Dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!++++@++++Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end.
Dad, Mr. Burns is here for you again.++++@++++Already?
A little tired of revenge, are we?++++@++++Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium.
It wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! Loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! So yes, thank you, Springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!++++@++++You're welcome!
Homer, are you scaring those kids?++++@++++No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London...
You said it was Boston.++++@++++Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs.
Like those chairs in the music room?++++@++++Possibly!
That coop looks a little flimsy.++++@++++Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.
Wow, Ray, you have hidden talents!++++@++++Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?
No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.++++@++++Way ahead of you.
Hey Homer, you ever think about racing that bird?++++@++++You can race pigeons?
Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?++++@++++Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty...
Congratulations, Homer.++++@++++Danica Patrick in my thoughts!
You Brickyard Bimbo!++++@++++Ended that a little too soon.
Dad! Help!++++@++++Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!
You haven't earned the right to say that to me.++++@++++Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: "Hope is the thing with feathers..."
How can you say a thing like that?++++@++++Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary.
No he doesn't!++++@++++Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!
Hey, in this economy, I'll even remove tattoos.++++@++++Even my tramp stamp?
Homie, why don't you study these?++++@++++Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!
So, Bart, as the one with the larger brain...++++@++++Nicely done, boy.
As sure as I am that I'll be billing you for that torn magazine.++++@++++Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?
What about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?++++@++++Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire.
Well, "ditching" is a harsh word.++++@++++Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.
It wasn't really a lot of chitchat.++++@++++It was still too much.
We'll take good care of your dog.++++@++++I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches.
Bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?++++@++++Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game.
Well, boy, I guess this is it. We've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption "Who's Walking Who?"++++@++++I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
I'd like a moment to ourselves.++++@++++Ooo, unknown caller!
And that last touchdown makes it sixty-seven to thirteen.++++@++++Maggie.
You mean your gingerbread McMansion.++++@++++Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that.
Hey, Simpson! How come you ain't in combat like a real man?!++++@++++I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
Don't dare bring that thing in here!++++@++++You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.
So I never want to see another Christmas tree... until Mom comes back, safe and sound.++++@++++Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could.
See? Every time we get a tree, Mom disappears!++++@++++Why couldn't it have been me?
It still could be. You just have to go down to the recruiting station and--++++@++++Shut up.
Yeah. My only sale all year and it's not even a sale.++++@++++Whose turn is it to cry?
Quitcher bellyaching about Marge and let me read the paper.++++@++++Look at that picture!
Yes, but then I learned that there's always hope. Someday this war will be over. Someday our Mom will be back.++++@++++Someday TV will be invented, and it will be free. Then it will cost money.
Now this... is a challenge.++++@++++Now remember, pack only necessities.
We brought you breakfast in bed!++++@++++Now we just have to make it.
...EVERYWHERE YOU GO++++@++++YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE
Hey, get this off! Hey, get this off!++++@++++Now nothing stands between us and sunny Hawa...
Merry Humbug, everyone!++++@++++Ai-yi-yi-yi!
Wait, what's this? Carpetbags and portmanteaus? Going somewhere, Simpson?++++@++++Uh... uh...
Simpson! Where's your Christmas tree?++++@++++Coming!
Just what's going on here?++++@++++Fine, I'll come clean.
It's a Christmas miraculum!++++@++++No, it's not. I just told a lie so we could go to Hawaii.
We did that one already!++++@++++Sh!
There is only one upside to today.++++@++++C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge.
I know when the freakin' Fiesta Bowl is!++++@++++Sweetie, relax. Let's just watch some TV.
Well, well, well. Simpson, you've committed Springfield's first crime of the new year. Write him up, Lou.++++@++++Huh? What'd I do?
Failed to separate your bottles and newspapers.++++@++++Fifty bucks?! That used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
That's vandalizing city property! Write him up again, Lou.++++@++++What the hell?!
Mild obscenity before ten a.m. Also illegal.++++@++++C'mon, Lou. Gimme a break!
Sorry, sir, I take no pleasure in it. Oh yeah.++++@++++Since when is all this against the law?
Since today. As of Jan one, a bunch of new ordinances -- with uh, outrageous financial penalties -- took effect.++++@++++This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
Fine. You're "Tellin' it like it is." Also a crime now. And that one's gonna cost ya.++++@++++That's almost a thousand dollars!
Homer Simpson, you are under arrest for attempted bribery of a public official.++++@++++Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write "bride." It's a wedding present.
Oh, how thoughtful!++++@++++My bribe!
Homer Simpson, you are hereby sentenced to ten years in the Federal Penitentiary!++++@++++It's okay, it's okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.
We're Simpsons, Dad. We don't do good behavior.++++@++++Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!
Ten years. That is a long time to be away from your family.++++@++++All that time I'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise...
Actually, most convicts work out like crazy.++++@++++I repeat: unable to exercise...
Simpson, we are currently conducting a twenty-year investigation into the activities of Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico.++++@++++What? This guy?
We're gonna plant you in Fat Tony's gang as an undercover informant.++++@++++I can't go undercover with Fat Tony. He's met me. I've been in his house. I was briefly his Consiglieri... Consugly... Canolli... Robert Duvall.
So we're gonna plant you in the prison with a disguise and a new name.++++@++++Can I be Johnny Undercover?
That's a little obvious.++++@++++Okay, Melvin Mafia.
No, you will be known as Nicky "Blue Pants" Altosaxophony.++++@++++Can I keep the name after I'm done?
Now pay attention. We're gonna move in on Fat Tony when he takes delivery on a shipment of Belgian guns. In your left sideburn is a fiber-optic camera. In your right, a wireless mic. To zoom in you go ayyyyy! To zoom out go ohhh!++++@++++Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!
You do know the meat is made from diseased pigeons.++++@++++Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
Time to go to work. Stop licking my hand.++++@++++There was barbecue sauce on it.
Here's how it goes down: I rough up Louie. Then you stand up to me, earning his trust.++++@++++But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
Enough of your dime store morality.++++@++++What's a dime store?
Hey Nicky Blue, you're one tough yegg. If you come out of your beatin' in one piece, you and I should have a face-to-face.++++@++++Beating? What beating?
Don't worry. We're not gonna touch you. We'll make it sound like a beating by tenderizing these steaks.++++@++++Can I have any of the steaks?
Whoa! I'm impressed over here with that guy over there.++++@++++Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!
Now let us escort you to freedom.++++@++++How're you gonna do that?
I detect a distinct lack of oregano.++++@++++I'll take care of this.
You carry oregano with you?++++@++++Oregano, basil, rosemary...
My beloved Anna Maria. I hope Heaven's powder room is painted that eggshell blue you could never achieve on Earth.++++@++++Sorry, boss.
No apology necessary. I am touched. You and me, Nicky, we feel. Legs, Louie, Jimmy the Axe, Tommy the Face Shooter -- they never share my grief.++++@++++Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.
You think an informant could get that close to me?++++@++++Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.
Why you! I'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a Rubik's cube, which I will never solve!++++@++++Well, I guess I could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette.
What's the matter, Nicky? You got a problem with this job?++++@++++Oh no! No! I... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
Nicky, welcome to the family. From now on, you don't know where you end and we begin. Your problems are our problems.++++@++++My neck is kind of itchy.
To heterosexual male friendship, the kind the Greeks wrote about.++++@++++Huh?
All units, move in!++++@++++Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!
Get a shot of Tony with the guns!++++@++++Ayyyy!
Closer...++++@++++Ayyyy!
Too close.++++@++++Ohhhh!
Closer.++++@++++Ayyyy.
He's dead.++++@++++No! You're wrong! Check again!
Homer, I just want to say that of all the rat bastards we've had working for us, you were the snitchiest.++++@++++So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?
And I'm not gonna shake your hand.++++@++++Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
Homie, I know you had a terrible experience, but it's over.++++@++++It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach.
You never took me to that bar on the beach.++++@++++Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good.
Sounds pretty good.++++@++++No, no, I oversold it.
No -- I'm his cousin from San Diego, Fit Tony.++++@++++Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising.
And there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch.++++@++++I understand. I loved him too.
Your tears seem in no way crocodilian.++++@++++Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there.
Well. This is awkward.++++@++++Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too.
This is gonna be great! A real rumble! Just like in that movie where the Jets fought the Sharks!++++@++++He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.
Homer, it is time... to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode.++++@++++Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.
No. Because my cousin lives on in your memories. And to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him.++++@++++Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?
It's pretty screwed-up. That's why I keep my friends close.++++@++++And your enemies closer?
No! Why would I do that? If they were close, they would kill me!++++@++++Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?++++@++++Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
You know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.++++@++++Been a while since our wives got together, huh?
I got a text!++++@++++Are you gonna open it?
No, that page isn't optimized for cell phone u... why am I talking to you?++++@++++Because you're my best friend in the room.
Oh, and Homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so I can have a girls' night out?++++@++++Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's.
Hey, how ya doin', Hom--++++@++++Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!
Thanks for the ride!++++@++++This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.
Shh!!!++++@++++Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?
And Anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? They went to the beach every day!++++@++++Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
We're not naked.++++@++++Right... neither am I.
I could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same.++++@++++Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--
Hey-diddily-hi, Homer.++++@++++Oh, you beautiful man.
That feeling is Mutual of Omaha.++++@++++God you're hilarious.
Hey look, the late shift's leaving.++++@++++I don't like those guys.
Yeah, they think they're better than us just because their performance reviews reflect that fact.++++@++++Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.
That's funny, 'cause I found this candy bar in my desk.++++@++++Time to punch in.
Yoink! Yah! Yah!++++@++++A dinosaur!
So, uh, what would you gentlemen like? I mean, I know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? Oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? I'm gonna pour some beers now.++++@++++Huh?
Hey, what's that guy doing in the men's room?++++@++++He's washing his hands.
You know, this is the first time I've ever been at Moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying "this is not a safe place to drink."++++@++++Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room.
I am not Comic Book Guy. I am his cousin, Comic Book Gay.++++@++++But you do like comic books.
We regret any confusion this may have caused.++++@++++Lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on.
Oh no, not "the face."++++@++++Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
Can I have it, Dad? Can I?++++@++++Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it.
What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?++++@++++Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.
Are you kidding? You're the worst dad who ever lived! I'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!++++@++++Why you little!!!
Homer, a good father is strong enough that he doesn't need to use his strength. What Bart needs is for you to strangle him with your love.++++@++++Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
How 'bout this? I let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.++++@++++Wish I could, son. I really wish I could.
There's nothing sexier than a man being a good Dad. Whoa!++++@++++Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun.
Dad, if I get an "A" on my math test, would that be worth some money?++++@++++Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward.
I did it! I got an "A"!++++@++++That's great.
Uh, Dad. If we could get to the reward...?++++@++++Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.
What the? I wanted a mini-bike! I told all my friends I was getting one!++++@++++Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.
Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!++++@++++Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break.
Mister Homer, you inadvertently left your nuclear plant security badge in the birthday card rack.++++@++++Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.
Well, I am more concerned with global terrorism. America's enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.++++@++++Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears.
Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. It's twenty-five years old.++++@++++Oh yeah? I'll show you.
Dad, I was thinking about it and... you're right. You shouldn't buy me something I didn't earn. And because you gave me the tough love I didn't know I needed, I'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you.++++@++++Awww...
I love visiting you at work, Dad.++++@++++And I love having you here, son. 'Cause you can wake me up if somebody comes.
No! Why in the world would you get me this?++++@++++Because you've been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.
I've got summer squash!++++@++++Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy.
Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old TV show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy.++++@++++Where is he going?
A teddy bear made in China!++++@++++Step away from the traitor!
KÄ›-shÃ¬ wÇ’-men nÃ©ng xÃ¬n de guÃ² tÄ huÃ¬ bÇŽ hÇŽo-chÄ«-de song-guÃ²-lÃ¡i ma?++++@++++I know what you're saying! I understand food talk in every language!
American fatso, your knowledge helped us build this plant. We would like you to have the honor of cutting the ceremonial ribbon.++++@++++Um... I'll see myself out.
You know, Dad, I really did have a good time hanging out with you.++++@++++Well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the TV.
I don't want to talk about my Mom's hair.++++@++++CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry "Don't Fear the Reaper." Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!
Boy, I love Valentine's Day. Stir a drop of JÃ¤germeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it "Cupid's Ambrosia," and you can charge up the wazoo.++++@++++Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman.
Well, I'm going to tell you my secrets right now...++++@++++Oh, thank you, prior obligation!
Homer! We only have five minutes until the school bus comes.++++@++++Drive my kids to school?! Never!
My first gray hair!++++@++++Oh Marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties.
Homie, you always mean to say the nicest things.++++@++++Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time.
We're running out of time, people! We need an answer! And it needs to be great!++++@++++So... chicken.
What do you think, Homie?++++@++++Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims.
"Jumping on the Grenade:" the wingman engages the less attractive friend, isolating the target.++++@++++You ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?
They're like dimes!++++@++++Yes, that's exactly it!
Well, a girl could starve to death!++++@++++Oh I know.
"Taking Down a Rival," aka "Talk Blocking."++++@++++So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?
Nice talk-blocking. Would you be willing to wingman for me?++++@++++Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work.
I just ordered this bottomless pitcher of beer and circumference-less platter of nachos.++++@++++Deal!
Oh Homer, I've never seen a drunk hold his vomit like you.++++@++++I do keep it together.
This is a situation I call "The Doctor Is Out."++++@++++Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.
True beauty isn't about hair color?++++@++++Probably.
But be honest, when I say "beautiful woman," what pops into your head?++++@++++Well, I guess I do have a "type."
Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?++++@++++Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
Oh hello, young man! Where's your father?++++@++++He's dying in a retirement home. Now kiss me.
Bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! Let's get this yo on the road, people!++++@++++Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!
Well that's my tip jar!++++@++++Mix it in.
I'm bored.++++@++++That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt!
You ate his yogurt in the car.++++@++++He didn't know that!
Is Bart Simpson here? Because I'm about to make him and his family very wealthy!++++@++++Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh?
The most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.++++@++++So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?
That's "Angry Dad"! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created!++++@++++I legally forced him to say "semi".
Don't thank me, thank Hollywood for being completely out of good ideas.++++@++++My little Roman Polanski!
Anything you can give us from real life?++++@++++Observe.
Hey Homer! You want to be the voice of Angry Dad?++++@++++It would be an honor!
Thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of Angry Dad will be on a speakerphone today.++++@++++There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your "table read."
'Angry Dad: The Movie.' Angry Dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."++++@++++"Family, today I graduate from my anger management class."
Angry Dad slips and crashes down the stairs.++++@++++Pained noises.
No Dad, don't say "pained noises," you make pained noises.++++@++++Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair.
Condiments by Mixar...and Angry Dad.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Sound mixers may not be glamorous, but they make us sound so good.++++@++++I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party!
I'M GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! I'LL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WON'T DE-CLARE IT!++++@++++Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
Uh... nobody. Wrong number.++++@++++If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble.
Say, why ain't you at the Oscars, A.D.?++++@++++Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.
That's cold.++++@++++Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
That means if another gang sees you, they'll kill you.++++@++++I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty.
This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.++++@++++You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit.
We can still order a replacement from the academy, right?++++@++++Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay.
This next move is tricky.++++@++++Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.
Okay, we're gonna take turns having Grampa as a roommate. Who wants to go first?++++@++++Me! Me! I want him every night, and forever and ever! 'Cause I love my--
Dad, look! This essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!++++@++++That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist.
Or I'll make dog-head soup outta ya!++++@++++Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!
Dad, is there anything unusual in Grampa's coffee?++++@++++Uh, you look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grampa's coffee.
Oh thank you, thank you!++++@++++Your kisses feel like raw liver.
Turns out it's not. The point is, when I'm cranky, nobody likes me, sweet pea. Let me live as a happy man for my remaining thirty years.++++@++++Come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! I wanna take Grampa to have his bellybutton pierced.
Homer, why don't you just make some more of the serum yourself?++++@++++Oh, because Lisa won't tell me what flower it's from.
Quiet. Sir, has your daughter found a drug that renders old people tolerable to us normals?++++@++++Yeah. But Lisa won't tell me how to make it.
Jawohl! I've isolated the molecule!++++@++++Nerd.
Oh, don't get me started on that one. They're just plain better than the greats of my day. God bless them, and their refusal to learn English.++++@++++Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.
Gentlemen, we've been doing a lot of funny things today, but now I must be scary.++++@++++Go ahead.
Why you little!++++@++++That's what I was gonna call it!
Wait, I can't go in there grinnin' like a Swede on payday -- it'll rile up poor Lisa if she knows I'm still poppin' that smiley-pill.++++@++++Oh yeah -- we better "grump it up."
No, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!++++@++++Your grandfather is not a monster.
Bart, why are you tugging on your collar?++++@++++It better be tonsillitis.
/ What? Well I never!++++@++++Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!
Homer, use your head. Just buy a new car!++++@++++Great idea, but I don't have any money.
You could take out a loan with your house as collateral.++++@++++And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?
Pretty close to zero, I'd say.++++@++++Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!
Springfield natives Cheech and Chong are returning in triumph for a reunion show!++++@++++Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?
Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?++++@++++Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!
Who are Beavis and Butthead?++++@++++I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!
Oh man, I gotta get rid of my grass!++++@++++He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
What are you guys doing up there?++++@++++Hide the dope!
We don't have any dope.++++@++++Then what did I just smoke?
It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I got the stuff.++++@++++I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
Well, how about this? Chong's not here! Man!++++@++++Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him!++++@++++I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.
Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him!++++@++++Dave's not here, man!
No man, I'm Dave. D-A-V-E!++++@++++Dave?
That's right. Now open up the door.++++@++++Dave's not here, man!
Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers...++++@++++I'll give Dave your message.
I don't find this funny at all.++++@++++My time being wasted was not wasted!
Hey man, you're alright! How'd you like to be the new Chong?++++@++++Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?
There is no Dave.++++@++++How 'bout Don Johnson?
And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids.++++@++++Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry...
It's not made of weed.++++@++++Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?
Look, Homer, I really need you to be on your game, you know? A lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical.++++@++++Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong.
Don't say that name! Now, you drive -- I have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a Magic Marker.++++@++++Can we get high from the fumes?
That's funny, Homer. Now we really have to work on the show.++++@++++Oh yeah, I getcha -- "work on the show." Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!
Yeah, I got it. Listen, man, comedy is hard work.++++@++++Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.
It is fun! The fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar!++++@++++CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...
You did all right, kid. You earned a reward.++++@++++Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech!
Here's your reward!++++@++++What the?!
Yeah! I'm taking you to a museum, man. Chong and I used to come here all the time.++++@++++Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
Now Homer, this Viramontes image is an example of how Chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by Eurocentric society.++++@++++Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?
Ah, that's just the movies, man.++++@++++Can we at least get some French fries?
Too high in trans-fats.++++@++++Stop speaking Spanish!
Now Homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time?++++@++++It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.
That's right. Now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts.++++@++++Yes, sir.
I can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.++++@++++Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are "insane?" Well, sometimes people can be too.
Hey baby, you want a ride?++++@++++C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this.
You mean you put nothing over nothing!++++@++++Tell him how you feel.
Yeah. Me too!++++@++++Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act!
Dave's not here.++++@++++Hold on, lemme get the door here.
You ruined it, man -- you weren't supposed to open the door.++++@++++Oh, okay, wait, let's start again.
Close the door.++++@++++I'll be out here with you, Dave.
Hey, Homer?++++@++++Yes?
Why don't you go and get us some stuff?++++@++++Okay. I'll go get some stuff.
All right. Way down there. Way, way, way far down there.++++@++++Way down here?
Yeah, keep goin'! Keep goin'! Now turn the corner! Turn the corner!++++@++++Okay!
Yeah, keep goin'!++++@++++All right!
It's me -- relieved!++++@++++Gee, sorry, Dave.
Just shoot already!++++@++++But I haven't finished my rituals yet!
Simpson, your sharpened-shooting has saved my life! Name your reward. Anything -- just name it!++++@++++All your money and all your stuff.
Lower and likelier.++++@++++Uh, Super Bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?
We'll stay for one inning, then we can go.++++@++++Well, this has been great. We should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting.
You're out of tonic.++++@++++Oh, that's right! I hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city.
Ooh, the "Fan Cam!"++++@++++EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! DO, DO, DO, DO / DO, DO, DO, DO...
Eh. This song's a little bossy for me.++++@++++Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!
Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone...++++@++++Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?
Dad, how could you do that? The whole audience saw me pee my pants!++++@++++Son, I'm really, really sorry.
Homer! Just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!++++@++++No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!
Unfortunately, the stain was picked up by Russian spy satellites, and President Dmitry Medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of American weakness. A Russian flotilla has just entered New York harb--++++@++++Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.++++@++++Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!
I told you you should've stopped the tickling.++++@++++Now I have to work overtime--
You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.++++@++++Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that.
That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.++++@++++I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
There's one right here!++++@++++Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!
You'll be fine, you always are.++++@++++I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.
Uh, Homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. What has that taught you?++++@++++Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart...
Wait. Hold on a moment. You were strangling your son?++++@++++Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said "Bart"...
You're actually serious! You physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?++++@++++I guess it's just how I was raised.
Um... why don't we stop there for today... and I'll see you next week.++++@++++Who do you have next period?
I told them not to come.++++@++++Why didn't you tell me not to come?
But today he's here to assist me with you.++++@++++Wha-wha-what are you doing?
Homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified.++++@++++No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!
Fool-hearty... tattooed...++++@++++Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again.
I believe we've made excellent progress here today. And after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...++++@++++Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance.
Good for you. No more drinkin'?++++@++++Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man.
I just got up, man.++++@++++Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.
Say cheeese!++++@++++Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.
Okay, first I'll send down my shoes.++++@++++All right.
Oh yeah? Look.++++@++++How many more, sir?
Fill the board then wash my car.++++@++++These are my keys.
Homer! Homer!++++@++++What?!
The school called and said Bart is out of control. I think we may need some therapy for him.++++@++++Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?
Now Bart, I want you to guide your father safely through these cacti.++++@++++Then what do we win?
Homer, desperate times call for desperate measures. If you hop down from that limb, I assure you Bart will cut you down.++++@++++I don't know...
This is a tough neck! Oh, it's so strong! Like an old...++++@++++Y'see? You see how that boy pushes your buttons?
Sue me for what? My home in a hollowed-out tree?++++@++++Pretty sweet, eh boy?
Actually, we pay them for each peach we take home.++++@++++What the? First we work, then I pay, then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?
C'mon, people. Peaches!++++@++++Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage.
Oh screw it.++++@++++Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything.
And George Washington took a trip down the...ear-y Canal!++++@++++My ear makes money?
Kid scissors. Lame.++++@++++Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
Aye ca-rum-ba.++++@++++I forgot why I'm doing this.
A peanut-butter-and-pretzel sandwich? There's no way a stupid Flanders like me could ever have thought of this.++++@++++Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down.
I can't! I never learned how!++++@++++I'll save you, Lisa!
Hey Dad, there's an arcade across the street... and there's really no point in all of us waiting in line...++++@++++Hmm...
I was invited to that party!++++@++++Boy that's good.
Next!++++@++++Woo hoo! First in line! Brought you a gift bag.
Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer.++++@++++And we've got front row seats!
I hope I'm not interrupting.++++@++++Fat Tony! I was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
I'm sorry, Fat Tony. My husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:++++@++++Oh my God!
All will be forgiven... If, you sketch a portrait of Patty showing her inner beauty.++++@++++You are cruel but fair.
Vi dichiaro marito e presunta moglie. You may now kiss one another.++++@++++Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?
He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result.++++@++++Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.
I still can't believe it. I have never been so snubbed at one of Selma's weddings.++++@++++Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!
Homer, to restore the sisterical bond, you and Marge are invited to spend the weekend with us at our house down the shore.++++@++++Hm. So, should I bring a towel?
We have towels.++++@++++Um, I take a special size.
I don't think this is a good idea at all. The only husband of Selma's I liked was Disco Stu. He was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.++++@++++Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach.
These people are always grinding against each other, and I think they're all related. I wish we'd never come.++++@++++Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!
Boo-frickin'-ya! Losers chug!++++@++++Well, if you insist.
TELL ME, WHEN WILL YOU BE MINE / TELL ME, QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO / HEY!++++@++++HEY!
The boys needed to breathe.++++@++++Wouldn't they be girls?
Oh, my poor Homie.++++@++++You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
Goomar?! That's mob talk for "mistress." Fat Tony has a mistress!++++@++++He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
Well, Homer and I are going to take you away right now.++++@++++Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled.
Whoa! You don't wanna be "that guy."++++@++++I don't wanna be "that guy," but Marge is making me be "that guy."
That's a goomar ring. This is a wife ring.++++@++++That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!
In a good marriage, you never say I told you so.++++@++++Which is lucky for me because you're always right.
Bart, I'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser.++++@++++I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible.
Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?++++@++++Fine, whatever.
Actually, it's kind of cute. You look like Posh Spice.++++@++++That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.
I hear this is the home of Springfield's hottest hairdresser. I need a haircut -- and I need it in three, two, one, now!++++@++++Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans.
One hundred.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Are you sure you don't have a salon?++++@++++Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so.
Too bad.++++@++++Just call me "Homer Fingerhands."
I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair.++++@++++Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head.
You better be!++++@++++Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon.
Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors.++++@++++Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?
All day long, Apu goes on about Lady Gaga, who is doing nothing that Rava Khatan was not doing twenty years ago, while she was a member of Parliament!++++@++++Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?
Because I have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. Turns out it was a substitute.++++@++++I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk.
I know Kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but Rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. That's what miniature dachshunds do.++++@++++Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa.
Hey, I don't want a conversation.++++@++++Oh?!
Homer, can you make me look fan-cy?++++@++++Sorry Sarah, I'm retired.
But tonight's the Policemen's Ball! And if you let my Sarah down I can make life very difficult for you.++++@++++I'd like to see you try.
Huh, where you goin'?++++@++++Excuse me.
Uh-uh-uh!++++@++++Come on! Would you--
I, uh, I can also make very annoying noises.++++@++++C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!
What? No! Just cut her hair!++++@++++Right.
Homer? I thought you were gonna quit.++++@++++I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands.
Why don't you do here what you do at the nuclear plant -- namely, suck.++++@++++Suck! Of course!
So, I told Timothy, you cannot keep basing sermons on old Seinfelds...++++@++++Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!
Stop talkin' crazy talk.++++@++++I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
It worked perfectly. As if anyone but you can make me feel this beautiful.++++@++++Aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life Warren Beatty lived in "Shampoo." And now it's time to pay you back...
Homie, you're making my toes curl. You sure know how to please a woman.++++@++++As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
Returned because of a fight over the pre-nup.++++@++++Awww...
She wanted a cake with blue rosettes, he slept with her sister.++++@++++Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!
Dad, our lives!++++@++++Fine.
That's the key to my box with the real skull.++++@++++Maggie!
So how come we have all these other keys?++++@++++Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--
Homer, stop him!++++@++++Stop who, Marge? Be specific.
Keys to the Duff Brewery?! Where'd you get those?!++++@++++Well, it might have been the time when...
Duffman doesn't need Duff to have fun! Seriously, you got any beer?++++@++++No.
Hey Homer, I really had you going there, huh? Homer?++++@++++When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!
Before somebody gets hurt!++++@++++So long, suckers!
But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.++++@++++Hey, kids!
What videogame is this like?++++@++++Blimp Assassin Three.
For Wii or Xbox?++++@++++Xbox.
Original or Three-Sixty?++++@++++Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!
Yes! And I've got gum on my shoe!++++@++++You're a real jerrrk!
That's not a real arm -- it's plastic!++++@++++That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero.
Oh, I'm sorry, Homie.++++@++++It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.
Whee!++++@++++Little help...
In all my years of teaching, I've never raised a hand to a student.++++@++++But you learned! You grew!
Uh Seymour, who's running this meeting?++++@++++I thought I was.
You've been in there for three hours! What are you doing, taking a bath?++++@++++Awww...
Oh come on, Ned, we've both been married before. Those two boys of yours weren't delivered by stork.++++@++++Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?
Homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?++++@++++Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry.
It's not funny at all. Homer, I'd appreciate it if you weren't so rude to Ned.++++@++++Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!
Language.++++@++++Yeah, language.
Don't do that, Homie. It rubs off your side hair.++++@++++Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?
See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. We're natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.++++@++++Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother.
If fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible.++++@++++Just the opposite of real life.
Oh my.++++@++++Ned, let's cut to the chase.
Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna.++++@++++Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded.
Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. Someone to put in my prayers.++++@++++Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.
That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time.++++@++++Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.
We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room.++++@++++Shut up.
My email address is Edna-lover-one-seventy-two. It was the lowest number I could get!++++@++++Guys, quit telling the truth!
Wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?++++@++++Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says "Walk This Way" was inspired by "Young Frankenstein?"
Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. Thanks a lot, neighbor.++++@++++Don't you mean "neighboreeno?"
No. Just plain neighbor.++++@++++You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!
I hope you're proud of yourself, Homer.++++@++++I've got some bad news for you, Marge. I'm actually not.
Well, there's Ned out on his power walk. Maybe you should talk to him.++++@++++Wha? My doctor said "don't walk."
And country!++++@++++Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!
We'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. Probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.++++@++++There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name.
Homer! Stop teasing!++++@++++Right. Teasing.
Homie, it was Maggie.++++@++++Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy.
Good evening. Tonight we reveal to you the fate of Nedna. I have devoted my summer to a more meaningful task: savaging Mr. Popper's Penguins online. Anyway, the answer to Ned and Edna is carefully hidden in tonight's episode like a breadcrumb lodged inside my stomach crease. Enjoy.++++@++++QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...
Hi, Homer!++++@++++I'M STILL DRUNK FROM LAST NIGHT, / GOT DRIVEN HOME, I DON'T KNOW BY WHOM.
I wouldn't know, sir.++++@++++Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that...
Hey, what's with that new security guard? He's acting all aloof. By the way, that's my word of the day: "he's."++++@++++Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?
Violent ward.++++@++++Good ol' Larry.
I prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. It, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past.++++@++++Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.
Hey, Wayne.++++@++++As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped.
Did you have a hard day too?++++@++++No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.
It's big to you. Would you like a "get well" pork chop?++++@++++I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please.
No, I was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called, so I told them to call back tonight for more accurate answers.++++@++++Oh. Okay.
All right, Homer. You win.++++@++++You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name.
Every town I go to I run into some guy just like this.++++@++++Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody.
...and I don't want you calling me at home and saying "turn on channel six"...++++@++++But what if the weathergirl--
Excuse me, I need to use the...++++@++++Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...
Thanks for the upgrade. Ha-ha!++++@++++Wayne?
That's comin' out of your stealings!++++@++++Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome.
Sorry. I have to go.++++@++++Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!
Hey Simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?++++@++++Sure. Why not.
Mother, is that you?++++@++++Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns.
Really? Are you sure?++++@++++Of course. I mean, how long could it be?
I have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.++++@++++That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future.
Un-fair! Un-fair!++++@++++That robot took our jobs!
My nightmares are real.++++@++++Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's.
I needed somewhere to lie low, and your town appears on no maps or charts.++++@++++Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating.
And when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got Lou Gehrig's disease.++++@++++Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one.
I am looking for a man named Wayne.++++@++++Oh, he's gone. I don't know where he went.
Are you friend of his?++++@++++He has no friends.
I see you are tight like borscht and beets. Tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of Wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend?++++@++++Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured...
This just in: a local man has been kidnapped by Ukrainian gangsters. We've received the following video.++++@++++Death to America!
Stick to script!++++@++++Fine. I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area. Turn the card.
Hold up today's newspaper!++++@++++What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
Perhaps we'll be living in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap.++++@++++Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete.
I won a silver medal in Nagano!++++@++++Cold. So cold.
So, Wayne, once again you crash my party.++++@++++So cold. Warm me up.
You ever eat on a train, Marge? What they call a steak is barely a hamburger. Now Homer, there's one more thing before I go.++++@++++Aww, that's what I call closure!
Buy a Springfield Elementary t-shirt?++++@++++I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
You don't have to yell!++++@++++Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!
Do I hear fifty dollars?++++@++++Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!
Mr. Simpson, I know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt.++++@++++Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do.
So!++++@++++What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
Hear hear! Hear hear!++++@++++Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?
How could we be? We're all in the same place and we don't have computers.++++@++++Marge, I parented!
That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!++++@++++Later, losers.
I'm thinking of something big. So big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!++++@++++Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.
Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you...++++@++++Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!
Come in and get some more!++++@++++You guys need to get a woman.
He had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.++++@++++Are you covering me up?!
Yes, I'm afraid we are.++++@++++The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!
Dude, you'd better see this.++++@++++I'm fine.
He opened his eyes! Mommm!++++@++++Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.
Just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.++++@++++Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!
Dad, I'm going to entertain you with the help of "The Brothers Karamazov." "Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place."++++@++++Oh my God! She's still on the first sentence! Must make her stop... how to express my...
Shhh. Don't say a word.++++@++++I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!
Homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob...++++@++++You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet.
Patty and Selma?! Who's next, Ned Flanders?++++@++++Now, how would that work?
Well, are we in Nebraska?++++@++++Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it.
Well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so I can't see the board.++++@++++And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
You made a killer out of me!++++@++++Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?
Because of you I'm going to Hell!++++@++++Language.
Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?++++@++++Why you little!... /
Roz Davis, your new assistant.++++@++++Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately.
I'm just a gal from Ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say "I need to borrow money."++++@++++So your dad has money to lend?
Genius.++++@++++Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!
Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy.++++@++++That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.
Well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'...++++@++++Oh well!
What made you think of that?++++@++++Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please.
Hmmm... Must make sure these wires aren't crossed.++++@++++Awww...
And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator.++++@++++Hm.
Simpson! A gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the Biograph.++++@++++Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
You're demoted.++++@++++Up or down?
Enjoy. And as for you, Homer, don't worry. You're at Moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three.++++@++++What the-- This is a gentleman's club!
Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?++++@++++Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here.
You're late.++++@++++Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say "I used to look like this..."
Late.++++@++++You're mean!
Now, I want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today.++++@++++Can one of the hundred be making the list?
Well, looks like it's time for another "'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned." Tonight's topic: "The Niceness of the Evening."++++@++++Hey.
Homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?++++@++++I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason.
Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been.++++@++++Is this her?
It is! But if you've got the stones, I can tell you how to slay that Gal-ioth.++++@++++Are you aware that "stones" means "man junk?"
And I haven't. Not until now.++++@++++That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!
Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of--++++@++++Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus!
What the deuce? Sarcastic clapping?++++@++++Congratulations, Roz.
What are you doing here, Simpson? If there isn't dry-cleaning in the back of my car, there's gonna be blood on my knuckles.++++@++++Uh, I just came to say that you're perfect. So perfect, I think Mr. Burns should give you a hug.
Who told you?++++@++++I won't say, but his initials are S.F.
Stupid Flanders.++++@++++Hug! Hug! Hug!
I underestimated you.++++@++++I don't know what that middle word means.
Well, it means my perception of you is that you were kind of a goof, but now I see you're rather clever.++++@++++What is perception?
It's how I view you. You understand that?++++@++++No.
I used to think you were an idiot. Now it turns out you're not such an idiot, in fact, you might even be smart.++++@++++Little help?
Rub the butter around you.++++@++++Need more butter! And not the unsalted.
Video game convention!++++@++++And check these out...
VIP passes!++++@++++Is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
Games don't have lives or points anymore, Dad.++++@++++I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
This is the funnest game ever!++++@++++Man, how many quarters does this game take?
Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!++++@++++And we're in Hall D. Three halls, three minutes...
She means the most authentic.++++@++++Out of my way! / Move it! / Geeks must yield to normals!
Room's full.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
Fun Dad rocks!++++@++++I need a nap!
The kids sure had a good time with you.++++@++++Yeah I was on today. Scary on.
How come they never call me "Fun Mom?"++++@++++Look, honey, a family's like a team. And on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee.
It's not fair. Moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff.++++@++++Okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day.
What if... We roll pennies and go to the dollar store!++++@++++That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system.
Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!++++@++++Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!
Relax, Homie. Have some leftover Galalalalalalalalah.++++@++++Oh no, I don't eat anything new unless I've eaten it before!
Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie! You're already a fatty and a drunkie!++++@++++I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to "savor" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?
I feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.++++@++++All right, food nerds, reality check...
It only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! And that third vote didn't come cheap!++++@++++And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!
Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now.++++@++++Fine. Blow off "Fun Dad," go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs.
Don't be so jealous, Homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me.++++@++++Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
Of what?++++@++++Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!
Homie, I don't want you to feel excluded. Would you like to come with us to dinner at El Chemistri?++++@++++Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?
Ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!++++@++++Fun Dad is a foodie now!
Oh, I doubt it. You sit at communal tables, full of hipsters.++++@++++Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat.
And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you.++++@++++So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun.
1501 W-- East Oak Street.++++@++++East Oak Street, is that it?
Quiet, man!++++@++++The experience begins!
Fifty bucks.++++@++++Ouch, this place is fancy.
You don't look like the kind of guy who does this.++++@++++Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong.
Pick up the meth! Pick up the meth!++++@++++This better be dinner theater!
Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. I'm calling Homer.++++@++++Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
This is nice -- a family fun day!++++@++++Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist.
... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end.++++@++++Ex-tinct!
How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.++++@++++Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?
Gift shop!++++@++++All right, you can each have one toy.
He gets four and I only get two?! No fair!++++@++++All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!
Wait! Wait! Come back! Dad! Follow that dinosaur!++++@++++I've waited my whole life to hear that!
Stegosaurus backplates, used for either defense or control of body temperature, comin' through!++++@++++So tired... go on without me.
Everything I believed about young adult literature is a lie!++++@++++It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!
Sir, you're inside an Allosaurus.++++@++++I demand to speak to my paleontologist!
Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?++++@++++A million bucks?
Every book on the "Young Adult" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!++++@++++I know five idiots!
And they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! It's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.++++@++++The perfect crime, eh?
Whatever the job is, I'm not interested.++++@++++A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
I like the beat -- play me the tune.++++@++++We're taking down kids who read.
Chapter-book crowd? That's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?++++@++++I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
Tween-lit gang-write?++++@++++Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.
A Zephyr?++++@++++You're the Zephyr.
This better not turn out like Kansas City.++++@++++It won't be like Kansas City.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?++++@++++The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
Uh, yes.++++@++++You're in.
I keep going over the job from every angle, but I can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.++++@++++Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville.
I'll show you! I'll write a book myself! A personal story my readers will connect with!++++@++++Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?
And the protagonist always discovers that he is supernatural!++++@++++Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!
Perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your "crew."++++@++++The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
Cheeseburgers, French fries -- I'm all over that, pal!++++@++++But why?
It's good. "Weekly Reader Star Selection" good.++++@++++I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is.
Who wants to see my cover mock-up?!++++@++++The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.
Hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, Lis.++++@++++Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.
Correction: finished manuscript.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
This is a really good book.++++@++++We know, we wrote it.
A dog wrote a bestseller?! Aargh! All I've done is procrastinate! Who am I kidding? There will never be a book with my name on it.++++@++++Or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
Do I have to do any writing?++++@++++No.
The trolls are now vampires, the Brooklyn Bridge is now a castle, and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball! Oh! Weak! Weak! And lame!++++@++++How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!
But teenagers weren't going to spend their allowances to join Team Schmul.++++@++++But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say "troll-y" instead of "cool?"
What you're feeling is called "pride of authorship." You thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together.++++@++++British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.
Kansas City.++++@++++Kansas City.
So, you thought you would un-ruin your book. If it's any consolation, you never had a chance.++++@++++Woo-hoo! All right!
No need to thank me, boys.++++@++++Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you.
I secretly switched the flash drives.++++@++++You switched the drives?
Your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.++++@++++Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke.
I have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no.++++@++++Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog.
COME JOSEPHINE IN MY FLYING MACHINE!++++@++++GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!
Indeed. That Homer Simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.++++@++++...So he says, "Bigamy is having one too many wives." To which I replied, "So's monogamy."
Simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here.++++@++++It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet...
When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position.++++@++++The last thing I understood in that was "pants."
Yes. Simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. It means a hefty expense account and a corner office.++++@++++Well, in that case...
Before you say yes, Simpson, I feel it's my duty to warn you... ...account men lose their soul.++++@++++Woo hoo! No more church!
The higher they rise, the further they fall!++++@++++You know, you're kind of a downer.
Hey, you're a baby account man. Still on the bottle. So for my last good deed before I retire, I'm gonna help you persuade Mayor Quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike.++++@++++Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?
There ain't enough bourbon in Kentucky for you, big guy.++++@++++Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.
Hey Homer! / Look at you, man!++++@++++I've outgrown you!
And if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.++++@++++Bo-ring.
Yeah, but work is over now. Wanna drink with me till I fall asleep?++++@++++Oh, well...
This set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.++++@++++Can you be my dad?
Dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story.++++@++++Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.
I'll read! I'll read!++++@++++And kiss.
Does anybody want my opinion?++++@++++Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today.
You make electricity. It runs the hospital!++++@++++You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it.
That's because it would kill you.++++@++++It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it.
I'm your wife.++++@++++My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy.
Your wife is here, Mr. S.++++@++++Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking...
Homer, I want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation.++++@++++Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?
The farthest thing from this office I know: rafting down Rattler River Canyon.++++@++++That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children.
Don't talk to me like I'm a client!++++@++++You're not a client. You're the client.
Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment.++++@++++I'll handle it. I always do.
Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water.++++@++++Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?
Coggily-doggily.++++@++++It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is.
But Mr. S... you just promised this week to Mrs. S, Master B., and Mamselles L. and M.!++++@++++Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.
And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.++++@++++Not sure what you're going for, but
It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.++++@++++Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in.
And yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!++++@++++Uh-oh. If you've got that, then...
Are you sure you're Martin Scorsese?++++@++++Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!++++@++++Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep...
Hurry! We're heading for the falls!++++@++++My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...
For God's sakes, Homer! I've given you three children!++++@++++Whose side are you on?
Well, Simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven.++++@++++Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun.
Oh, I'm so glad you're not an Accounts Man anymore.++++@++++Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant.
We have to see the Museum of TV before next Wednesday when it closes forever.++++@++++It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?
Whoa! The gun Sheriff Baby wore! Hm.++++@++++Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.
Not so hard. She'll know we have a past.++++@++++And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!
Who's Fatso Flanagan?++++@++++Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
Isn't that just a rip-off of "The Honeymooners?"++++@++++Everything's a rip-off of "The Honeymooners." Margie, you're the greatest.
Just you wait, Eunice! Just you wait. Ka-chik, Kaboom, Ka-Splatter! See yer grave there?++++@++++They were so childless and miserable.
The size forty-eights. That's when he was the funniest.++++@++++How would you know?
If you ever hear a star's name and wonder "is he dead?" The answer is either I represent him, or "yes."++++@++++Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?
Would you play a bloated corpse on "CSI?"++++@++++Would I!
Come on in, it's a long story.++++@++++Now I hate him too.
I was so mad at him, I didn't have sex with a clown for five months.++++@++++What about mimes?
They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.++++@++++Good one, boy.
Which means, it's the start of Christmas season...which means...++++@++++Christmas card photos?!!
Not me, man. This cycle of jerks has to end.++++@++++Are we done yet? "It's A Wonderful Life" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie...
I see you are reading a children's book. Yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult. Is there an error?++++@++++Shut up!
Why do you say "future?" This is now.++++@++++I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
I just got a message from Maggie in my brain.++++@++++Ooo, a b-mail!
She's coming home for Christmas! And Bart's bringing the boys! And Lisa's coming with Zia! For once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!++++@++++Hey, I got a b-mail too! "You have won a valuable prize! Open now"...
Don't open it, Homie! It's a virus!++++@++++Too late!
Hey Grampa. Are you gonna build a snowman?++++@++++No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke.
Thanks for spending so much time with us, Dad.++++@++++Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
Are they working on one?++++@++++Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home.
Ah, I don't see what's great about 'em! And Homer, you're still a big disappointment. Because...++++@++++See you next Christmas!
Why did you bring us here, Homer?++++@++++To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em.
You've taught us the meaning of Christmas, which schools are forbidden to tell us any more.++++@++++Is it snowing down here?
No, one of the freezers is busted.++++@++++If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive...
Lawn chair-breakin'-- Hair-losin'-- Marge-lovin' barometer-dropping-- Father-freezin'-- But you'd always come and get me when I wandered out on the freeway -- 'cause deep down you couldn't bear to see me smooshed.++++@++++I love you, Dad.
Cousin Kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt.++++@++++I just don't understand the world of grownups.
Sorry sir, your bag is two pounds over the limit. Are you sure everything inside is essential?++++@++++Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
I told you not to pack them!++++@++++Don't argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!
They self-reference each other.++++@++++Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?
That's toothpaste!++++@++++Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!
I need my books!++++@++++Try to catch one on your tongue.
Sir, you've been selected for a pat-down.++++@++++Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
Sir, there isn't enough room.++++@++++Yes there is! Woo hoo.
Welcome to flight 55 to Bozeman, Montana by way of Miami. Due to an unforeseen jailbreak in New South Wales, our takeoff is gonna be just a little bit delayed. So we're gonna be turning off the air, but ethnic people are permitted to open and eat their home-cooked food.++++@++++Huh? What the--
Sir, return to your seat.++++@++++But I have to go to the bathroom!
You should've thought of that before you drank the fluids you need to live!++++@++++Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
Come on, ladies. You're all deputies now.++++@++++Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!
Why are you in disguise?++++@++++Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public.
When I heard Homer speak I no longer felt small.++++@++++They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!
I'm Nash Castor! Coming up, we butt heads with Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan and Mitt the Wonder Romney! But first, we're here with this guy my kid said was a thing: Homer Simpson.++++@++++Woo hoo! I'm famous again!
That's a great point, Adriatica.++++@++++Well, if I could explain myself...
Homie, you can win this argument! Just rant and rave like you do to the TV during sports!++++@++++Yes. Yes! Got it!
And we're back with Homer Simpson, who's about to become a soggy Pamper flung to the side of history's freeway in three.. two...++++@++++Not so fast!
Everything's closed!++++@++++Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!
From now on when someone asks me, I'm gonna say you are my father.++++@++++Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked.
Homer, you're getting your own show.++++@++++Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
That's not you. They just painted Shrek yellow.++++@++++It's still a great honor!
Dad, I'm glad your show is successful, but I have to ask you: what's with the crying?++++@++++Great question. I know you children have never seen your father cry before... Marge, do we have any more gravy?
No, we're out.++++@++++Why? Oh why?
Homie, I'm glad you're passionate, I just hope you're not riling people up with your show.++++@++++Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich.
So, what's this with the gravy boat?++++@++++Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.
You know, symbols can often rile people up. The swastika... the New York Yankees logo...++++@++++Don't worry, sweetie. I think I know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy.
Speaking for Lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore.++++@++++Then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
Um, none.++++@++++Only one hundred percent?
Dad, you shouldn't do this. It's not fair how much influence you have!++++@++++Now Lisa, I'm an entertainer. And you can't entertain and inform at the same time. And if you're Access Hollywood, you do neither!
Now they're all excellent choices, so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer and we'll elect him.++++@++++I don't know. Can't we get Chris Christie to run?
Save me, Obama Care!++++@++++Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans.
Dad, you cannot endorse Ted Nugent. I mean, sure, we all love his music...++++@++++Oh, yes.
Arise, Homer Simpson!++++@++++Huh? Who's there?
Now come, and I shall teach you of democracy!++++@++++Can we get some pizza on the way?
I don't want gas station pizza!++++@++++So, how come your picture's not on money?
Actually, I'm on the five thousand dollar bill.++++@++++Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.
I want to show you something.++++@++++What's this? Some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
These are the framers of the Constitution, Homer. This great nation is built upon the hard work of, well as you would say, "nerds."++++@++++Nerds! You want I should mess 'em up?
You are an embarrassment to the aristocratic slaveholders who forged this mighty nation!++++@++++But gravy is the freedom where--
Silence! Founding Fathers! To me!++++@++++Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...
Homie, wake up.++++@++++It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!
Oh, Dad! I'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason.++++@++++Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?
I did it just to mess with your mind.++++@++++That's what a play within a play is for!
No strangling on school days!++++@++++Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators.
Come on, hurry up and cry so I can get elected and open up the San Diego Zoo for big game huntin'.++++@++++It's not working... But why?
Maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing.++++@++++Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut.
THERE IS A NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT IS SWEEPIN' THE LAND / AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY ME / AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD WHILE I WAS WASHING MY DOG / SUCK ON THAT FRANCIS SCOTT KEY...++++@++++I GOT A GOOD SONG FEVER / A TED NUGENT FEVER / SOMETHING SOMETHING FEVER...
Sing it, Homer!++++@++++I GOT THIS SONG FEVER
U.S. OF A!++++@++++U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--
Well, McBain. You certainly picked a bad time to come out of retirement. I hope you have a... Cobra plan.++++@++++Down in front!
Homie! Stop watching the movie in the other people's car!++++@++++But I'm invested in the characters.
You'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!++++@++++I make my own turnoffs.
Someone thinks we're leaving. I'll wave them off.++++@++++No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home.
Dammit, are you leaving or not?++++@++++Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?
We totally wasted his time.++++@++++And ours!
I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.++++@++++Do-over!
I wish my dates were this interesting.++++@++++I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.
I already have.++++@++++Sweet!
I have no friends.++++@++++Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?
Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!++++@++++And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!
And I created an alcoholic hippo!++++@++++You never showed it to me.
A stupid alcoholic hippo!++++@++++I still wanna see it.
There is no hippo!++++@++++Then why did you say it?
'Cause you're the hippo!++++@++++Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
Help us, Larry Summers!++++@++++Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...
No. We want your Dad.++++@++++Marco!
You were only supposed to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.++++@++++Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
Uh... there once was a boy named Ali Baba. He and his elder brother Cassim were the sons of a merchant who traded in camels and spices and--++++@++++Needs flavor.
Rag soup!++++@++++That's better.
I was part of an expedition to the top of Mount Everest. One that had the distinction of failing un-heroically.++++@++++Oxygen... I need oxygen.
Why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on Valentine's Day?++++@++++We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day.
"My darling husband. This Valentine's Day, I have a present for you..."++++@++++Thanks for reading it to me.
It's okay, Homie. Go. Have a good time. Take Bart with you!++++@++++Which one do you want?
Somehow I missed that phase.++++@++++Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there.
Oh, my. I don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before.++++@++++Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there.
My mother said I should bring some wine.++++@++++Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys.
She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe.++++@++++Did you say "ultimate Frisbee?"
All Springfielders should now move off the streets and inside their homes. Please avoid the superstitious panic which marked the recent lunar eclipse.++++@++++Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.
I know it's futile, but I must again point out there is no dragon.++++@++++Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
Again, I maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance.++++@++++Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book.
I pick up books like you pick up beers!++++@++++Then you have a serious reading problem.
Now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...++++@++++So do your farting now.
Homie! What if that was the last thing you ever said?++++@++++Don't worry. My last words will be "I can outrun that lion."
Not me.++++@++++Two can play at that game.
I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!++++@++++And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good.++++@++++Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?
Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?++++@++++Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy.
The simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after Homer's drunken shenanigans...++++@++++We won! Woo hoo!
Simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter...++++@++++Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought.
If you see a Simpson, do not try to reason with it. Just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda.++++@++++Soda, eh?
Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan?++++@++++Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!
Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm.++++@++++Fine.
I just got started!++++@++++Not you! Him!
Rejected by society, huh? Well, why didn't you say so? Welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call "The Outlands!"++++@++++We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window.
THE OUT-LANDS!++++@++++Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back.
Should I get my helmet?++++@++++Helmet? That's Springfield talk.
Is there gas in these?++++@++++Springfield talk!
Well how are we supposed to get fuel?++++@++++Private plane crashes.
Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile.++++@++++Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives.
Don't be ridiculous. It's an Afghan wedding being bombed.++++@++++Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.
He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies.++++@++++Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.
Yes it does.++++@++++Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield.
Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone.++++@++++Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!
Mr. Burns! You might catch a cold out this late. You want my jacket? Here, lemme warm my gun up for ya.++++@++++Excellent.
Wanna make out over the foul line?++++@++++Ever since the day we met.
Yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow.++++@++++Someone's downstairs!
That is pretty smart.++++@++++All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?
Cancel their subscription to the opera!++++@++++We hate opera!
Then get them a subscription to the opera!++++@++++Nooo!
Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more...++++@++++Yeah. Non-jerks!
You sure this is a good idea?++++@++++This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!
I'm-I'm-I'm here as a friend, looking for a better way of life!++++@++++Hey Lenny, welcome aboard.
Get her off! Get her off!++++@++++Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep.
Hey! Guys! What can I getcha?++++@++++Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
I probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on Yelp.++++@++++Well, I rented that plane.
I, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new Eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government.++++@++++True, true.
Dad, I wanted to give you a heads-up. Mom's birthday is tomorrow. It's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting.++++@++++You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present.
Wha--? Mom is gonna love that!++++@++++Love?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere "love" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed.
By who? Lenny?++++@++++By the box lady herself!
These'll go great with betel nut butter!++++@++++Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.
Now see here. I have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. And friends do not betray friends!++++@++++Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
Convenience forever, freshness never!++++@++++Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
How would you like it if I called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?++++@++++You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!
Now, last but not least, your present, Homie.++++@++++Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever.
Well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good.++++@++++The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one...
Please don't say one again.++++@++++Onnneee.
Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening.++++@++++This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
Well, at least you remembered I like her.++++@++++A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.++++@++++You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
I think that's enough birthday fun.++++@++++Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!
No way, man! I'm a free-range kid!++++@++++No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
Don't wanna come out.++++@++++What?
I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.++++@++++Boy, get out of that cage!
But it's my home now, sir.++++@++++I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!
Tag, we're it! Springfield has been hit hard by a mysterious graffiti artist and his iconic calling-card, which we have dubbed "Mr. Fatso."++++@++++Heard about this thing, boy?
No, no, I'm too concerned with unemployment.++++@++++Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?
Homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?++++@++++Not now, Marge!
I carumba? Not so loud! If my Dad hears about the show, he might realize Mr. Fatso is him!++++@++++What the--
C'mon, Dad. You made me mad so I got back at you. How was I to know parents had feelings?++++@++++Well, we do.
I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:++++@++++You just ruined my car.
Correction. It's worth ten times as much.++++@++++Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy.
You're welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me.++++@++++Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?
Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?++++@++++Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in.
Well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow.++++@++++Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car.
Hey, the supply room's open. I better close it.++++@++++Unguarded stuffff...!
Can someone open this bottle of mother wolf placenta for me?++++@++++Mr. Burns! Save me, panic!
Only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... Homer Simpson!++++@++++How ya doin' there?
Now Simpson, how is it that you alone manage to keep your moral compass pointed to true north?++++@++++Well sir, before I do anything I stop and ask myself, "What would Jesus and Mr. Burns do?"
I can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!++++@++++Hey, it's called "karma."
Isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?++++@++++A common misconception.
Why? Are you going to do the laundry?++++@++++Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!
Ho-mer! You do not yet understand the meaning of kar-ma!++++@++++But isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
That is beside the point, okay? If something bad is happening to you, it must be because of something you did to others.++++@++++Deep down, I must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! And my problem won't stop till I make things right with them. But first, a little more sleep.
A lot of work went into this thing.++++@++++So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?
Ain't no problem that free food and free booze won't fix!++++@++++Free? Uh...
What's goin' on? Is this a joke?++++@++++Son, I'm afraid the Uralarm Whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke.
What is going on?++++@++++Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed.
We're wetting the bed?++++@++++Hey, when you were pregnant everything was "we."
I'm sorry, Homie. A diaper just isn't sexy.++++@++++What about Cupid? He's smokin' hot.
He's a baby with wings!++++@++++Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside.
Trying to fix your broken brain.++++@++++What do I do?
You wet the bed?!++++@++++Great, now Death knows.
What do you see?++++@++++Um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
Welcome back, handsome.++++@++++Uh, Marge, this is my friend Keggy...
In this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart, you get your change in bacon.++++@++++Woo hoo!
We know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...++++@++++Oh, lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the Lost and Found. Well guess what? We're stayin' in this dream forever!
...death.++++@++++Mom?!
No, but I live on in Homer's dreams.++++@++++Just like my hair.
That's Jennifer Aniston's hair on "Friends."++++@++++Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing.
Something that just might help Homer wake up dry.++++@++++Wow!
Man, Homer, you've always been a loser.++++@++++Why you little...
Pathetic. A kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.++++@++++It's true! I failed the basic duty of childhood. And then when I took Bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!
And maybe you'll stop overeating too!++++@++++No can do, baby.
And now you'd better run along, sweetheart.++++@++++Goodbye.
We'll take your word for it.++++@++++So what do I do again?
Spin the top. If it falls over, we're in reality. If it spins forever, we're still in a dream.++++@++++All right.
Is that hail coming down?++++@++++It's just dream hail! Ow! Oh! Ow! Dream hail! Hey, there's a dream truck!
Think he's okay?++++@++++Thank you.
Oh yeah, you don't wanna go to the hospital at five o'clock on a Friday.++++@++++Woo hoo! Thank God it's T.G.I.F!
Some casual Friday this is.++++@++++You're outta here, drug-o.
Homie! You're home early!++++@++++Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.
Company physical coming up, huh?++++@++++Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.
...you promised to help me write a haiku...++++@++++Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?
And you and I were going to study the municipal voter's guide.++++@++++What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1. In the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of Congress at the beginning of each decade, the Legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of Congressional, State Senate and Assembly districts. Liquor... mustn't think of liquor...
Homie, what are you drinking?++++@++++A surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
There's champagne in those!++++@++++Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.
No! Irish and Long Island!++++@++++What about this lemonade?
Mike's Hard!++++@++++Then I'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! Oooh, cake!
Rum cake!++++@++++Crepes!
Suzette!++++@++++Cherries!
Wow, passed with flying colors! I've sure earned this!++++@++++Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord...
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the future masters of the human race.++++@++++Comicon nerds!
Sir, I'm afraid we do need to keep one human worker to sign for packages, a scapegoat for meltdowns, things that would be a waste of the robots' time.++++@++++A must!
So we need one meat sock on the payroll. But who?++++@++++Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push "popcorn". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought.
Simpson, wait! As it turns out, there is one job available. But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom.++++@++++Does the chair go back like this?
The buyer clearly specified violin and bow!++++@++++Maybe I should be heading home.
Human interaction mode activated. Initiate conversation.++++@++++Will you be my friend?
Friendship cannot exist between man and machine. But I can simulate interest in your statements.++++@++++You're not a friend... you're my best friend. Uh, just don't ask me to drive you to the airport.
Sounds like you are having... family difficulties.++++@++++That's exactly what I'm having! You guys totally get me.
We are programmed to respond to your verbal prompts.++++@++++Could you give my wife a few lessons?
Hmmm... your laughter indicates you do not wish us to give your wife lessons.++++@++++Yeah. So uh... it's five o'clock. Time for Moe's.
Five.++++@++++Let's go!
Automated workers are not able to leave the plant.++++@++++What happened to you guys? You used to be cool.
We are the same temperature we have always been.++++@++++We're the same temperature we've always been.
According to the online rules of baseball, all players get a turn "at bat."++++@++++Uh, right, right... actually, I'm the designated hitter for all you guys.
The designated hitter corrupts the purity of an otherwise elegant game... Illogical, illogical.++++@++++Fine. Don't get your circuits in a bunch.
Circuit-bunching has yielded important advances in modern robotics. To wit...++++@++++Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!!
We will notify you if this game becomes meaningless.++++@++++I got it...
Liability opt-out button...++++@++++That could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
Our primary directive... is to preserve human life.++++@++++And here I was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. You know, it's crazy, but...
Homer... move away from me. You are still in the road.++++@++++Hush, bionic prince, as I cradle your waning form.
Can I hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?++++@++++No! I'm already using it to put my keys in!
Alcohol is harmful to humans.++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath.
We do vent nitrogen once a year. You do not want to be around for that.++++@++++I have some adjustments to make.
Homer, when am I gettin' my power drill back?++++@++++When I'm done with my robo-botomies.
Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots.++++@++++Flanders, I don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. I look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws.
Eliminate impediment. Eliminate.++++@++++Just say "kill me," jerks!
Dad, they can only go three miles an hour!++++@++++I'm doomed! Can they climb stairs?
With great difficulty!++++@++++I'm doomed!
Flee, you fool!++++@++++Aren't we getting num-nums?
Stop brandishing me!++++@++++Sorry. Before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?
To servos with love!++++@++++Guys, thank you. The words "prime directive" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings.
I told you precisely that fact one thousand five hundred sixty-two t--++++@++++And his arm can be my back-scratcher.
Homer, why have you reprogrammed me for this?++++@++++I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
I am real and I do not have wishes.++++@++++Then take us out to sea.
I am not a transformer. I cannot turn into an outboard motor.++++@++++Oh, I believe you, but Flanders' drill doesn't.
That movie's for babies.++++@++++Watch whatever you want -- I got you here alive. Now I'm gonna visit the only court I could never be in contempt of: food court.
Sir, I can't help but noticing that you are very near death.++++@++++Closer than you think!
Homer... can I call you Homer?++++@++++Sure. What's your name?
I'm not required to tell you that. Homer, how long do you want to live?++++@++++Long enough that me and Marge can be one of those couples who just sit and hold hands.
This is the Butt-Whisperer 9000: cushioned track...++++@++++Ooh!
Hydration dock...++++@++++Gotta have that!
Built-in HD TV...++++@++++Lovin' it!
Dog-walk side-path...++++@++++Keep 'em comin'!
Run, you maggot! Faster, you tub of lard!++++@++++It's programmed to my specifications!
Homer, you can't afford three hundred dollars a month?++++@++++No.
Well, what about ten dollars a day?++++@++++Easy!
Why did I see that movie the day before I have to clean the crawlspace?++++@++++C'mon, boy. We've gotta go home. I saved big bucks on the delivery charges.
Wow, the TV's hooked up to the internet! You can stream whole seasons of old TV shows.++++@++++Hmm...
"Stranded" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. It was huge! Well, the first season and the last season.++++@++++Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.
Where are we??++++@++++What a great opening episode. And I'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
I'm just not ready for cookies!++++@++++You know, I should get back to the treadmill.
I might be back!++++@++++The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on "previously on."
You're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? And when I wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!++++@++++Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved.
Oh my God! It's just like Dad's!++++@++++Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was "enigma" spelled backwards? What does it mean?
It means use the treadmill for running or take it back!++++@++++And where will I watch TV?
On the TV!++++@++++And where will I walk?
On the ground!++++@++++And where...
This is the stupidest fight ever!++++@++++We've had stupider!
It means I'm mad!++++@++++Oh that's such a first-take answer!
Hey, I loved that show. Wasn't it awesome when Colonel Darkwater--++++@++++Spoiler alert! I've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: "Coconut Cream Die."
So you don't know that Season Five was a complete wank.++++@++++Spoiler!
Homer, calm down. It's not like any of this stuff really took place.++++@++++Spoil-er!
Homer, for God sakes, I'm trying to put Maggie to sleep!++++@++++I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die.
You wanna know what happens on your stupid show? Firstly, the "mysterious island" is fifteen miles from Long Beach. Also, Doorway Three led to Hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to Hell, and the entire Strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!++++@++++Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now.
Care to join me in a private "last episode party"?++++@++++Well...
It's okay, Dad. He's just putting the fear of God in me.++++@++++Okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.
I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at "Mr. Steak."++++@++++Again with "Mr. Steak!" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!
Well of course they don't.++++@++++Why don't you talk to Mrs. Steak?
Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us.++++@++++Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
I can't, I sold my "dinner futures."++++@++++Nice doin' business with you, boy.
And Dad donated something, too.++++@++++What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
We sold it to pay for a family cruise!++++@++++I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
It's weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!++++@++++Oh, Marge... your names...
Homer! This is bad for you, too!++++@++++WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT! WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT!
Homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.++++@++++Sex on a family vacation? I never thought such a thing was possible!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!++++@++++Ocean sex rules! Go to Hell, land sex!
Two diplomats' sons are in love with me. Who will I choose: Ghana or Portugal?++++@++++Boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- "before you were born" fun.
Where did the ship stop again?++++@++++I'unno... Lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely.
So remember, rule number one is "Always Have Fun"... because fun is the only thing that will keep us alive! Fun!++++@++++Worthless, worthless, worthless...
What a load of crap!++++@++++Can I put my hand through you?
Bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths.++++@++++Yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill.
Uhhhhh... gotta go!++++@++++Man, I kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! I won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! I got robbed by marauders on the way home.
After this I'll be lucky to get work on a clothing-optional, Jimmy Buffett cruise!++++@++++What about the duty-free stuff we bought?
Never Have Fun!++++@++++My booze and cologne!
Well sure life is full of pain and drudgery, but the trick is to enjoy the few perfect experiences we're given in the moment.++++@++++Yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!
That's my hobby. This is my job.++++@++++Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
There was enough talking during the movie! This date night was even worse than the date night we saw "Date Night."++++@++++Oh man, Marge is pissed. Look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head...
Just take me home.++++@++++That's what she said!
Boy Homer, I gotta say, Marge looked pretty easy on the eyes last night. And I know eye-ease!++++@++++Yeah.
Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?++++@++++No, just my marriage.
That's a good thing!++++@++++But you said it so mean!
Not in the mood.++++@++++No, this is really good. I...
Nelson took my lunch money again!++++@++++Now, listen, Lisa--
No one will tell me if I'm a ghost or not!++++@++++Well, I just got...
Got what, Homer?++++@++++Uh... I got... Shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
Homer, I'm a single mother trying to raise a family here.++++@++++But you're not...
Just zip it!++++@++++I have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know.
I have to take Maggie for her checkup. And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.++++@++++I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work.
Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door.++++@++++Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me.
Stranger things have happened, Homer.++++@++++Stradivarius Cain!
C'mon! Really? Show a little class.++++@++++Sorry.
Now I'm about to undertake my toughest mission ever: to make you into a man your wife can't resist.++++@++++What the? No one can see you.
I must say, whoever installed your car's secret weapons did a great job hiding them.++++@++++Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons.
What?! Well, does your car at least turn into something else?++++@++++Sometimes Marge says I turn it into a trashcan.
Homer, you are going to clean up this car, put on cologne, and become a sparkling conversationalist.++++@++++Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
Now, the ultimate test: I want you to convince that woman to give herself to you body and soul.++++@++++But I'm a married man.
Yeah. I know a married man is never attracted to a beautiful woman he doesn't even know, but this will give you the confidence you need with Marge.++++@++++Okay, I'll make a stranger love me forever.
And Homer, remember: it doesn't matter what you say, as long as you say it with confidence.++++@++++My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
Okay, it matters a little what you say. Moving on...++++@++++You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
Look, just say this++++@++++When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes.
Busy day at work? Did you get a lot of work done, workerman?++++@++++What do I do? What do I do?
Take her by those shoulders she never covers, and tell her the truth.++++@++++You're right, Marge. I lied.
Don't give me that load of--++++@++++I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation.
Head injury?! Why didn't you tell me?++++@++++And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. The kind of husband you deserve.
This car's so clean! I'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!++++@++++I have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.
Why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?++++@++++It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. Of course she fell for me and of course I wanted no part of her. Now, the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain.
The guy from the movie?++++@++++I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!
How can a fat man hide so well?++++@++++Strad, where are you?
You can handle him, Homer. Just remember what I taught you.++++@++++When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes.
Then why did he say he'd call me when he comes to Bolivia?++++@++++We used to be like them.
So, how many more weeks do you have off?++++@++++Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. We'll just wait for the call from human resources.
I prepared right!++++@++++Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy.
Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?++++@++++I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
Also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!++++@++++Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories...
Krusty Versus the F.D.A....++++@++++Game Six of the 2011 World Series...
Hitler Mash-ups.++++@++++...And Lenny's story about Cancun.
He said simple things that many followed.++++@++++Just like me on Twitter!
After an all-night dinner.++++@++++Woo hoo!
Well, congratulations, Homer. Guess this is just my cross to bear.++++@++++What's that a reference to?
First of all, congratulations on getting the lead.++++@++++Whee! Whee!
I just hope you're gonna take this seriously.++++@++++Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee.
It'll be fine. Just learn your lines.++++@++++Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?
He's in every scene.++++@++++What?! Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?
Hoo boy! Okay, be straight with me -- you can probably plead this down to crucifixion. Do you call yourself "King of the Jews?"++++@++++Thou sayest it!
Crucify him!++++@++++They cannot judge me. Only my Father can judge me.
Jesus was handed a heavy cross, and upon his brow was placed a crown...++++@++++Ooo!
...of thorns!++++@++++What the?
This man is totally the son of God.++++@++++Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven.
Never again will I question...++++@++++Outta my way, stupid Flanders!
Hey Dad, you remember when you said if Flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?++++@++++Uh-oh.
Congratulations, you two! We're so, so happy for you!++++@++++Welcome to marriage! Another good man bites the dust.
Yo, Homer! Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders'!++++@++++Bart! Don't call me that!
Which one? Homer or fat ass?++++@++++Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!
Ned, Edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room...++++@++++People here do not respect boundaries.
Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?++++@++++Sorry.
Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun.++++@++++Great, we'll take care of everything. We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners.
We haven't taken in one car all day.++++@++++You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.
Why does that make him right?++++@++++He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about.
Bart, is there something you want to tell us?++++@++++Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies.
That is totally irresponsible parenting!++++@++++Not according to the internet!
Where on the internet?++++@++++I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
Why would you believe him?++++@++++Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
Ned, I realized long ago, there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on.++++@++++Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry.
It's angry.++++@++++Don't tell me what our thing is.
It's about not agreeing on something.++++@++++I've always said "hungry"!
I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!++++@++++I thought I heard clicks and pops!
Now in our fiftieth location in Springfield, Sleazy Sam would like to welcome our special grand opening star, Jesus.++++@++++Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--
FIRST BASE, YO! / I LIKE CHRISTIAN RAP / A BIBLE ON MY LAP...++++@++++WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!
Now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. I stopped reading after "TOP STUDENT".++++@++++You wanna honk your jazz tube?
What is the point? I think this is the end of me. All I had was my integrity. And now that's gone. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I try not to cry till you're asleep.++++@++++I appreciate that.
Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to...++++@++++Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down.
It's not a frown. It is a straight line of resignation. Looks just the same upside down.++++@++++What are you talking about? Y-you're right!
Dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help.++++@++++I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma! Ga-ga-ra-ma-ma!++++@++++Hey Lisa, come on.
It's just human contact.++++@++++No.
Stop it, Homer! Some of that meat is me.++++@++++Can I just trim the hem?
Dad, thank you. Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful I have been. Which means I've got a train to catch.++++@++++Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.
I'm speaking fast because I'm so excited. Seeing Maggie Simpson in her first starring role in "The Longest Daycare" in 3D before Ice Age Continental Drift, only in theaters! We've already done the hardest part: making the poster!++++@++++I LOVE MY HOMER FACE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID / RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF MY HEAD / STUBBLE, MUZZLE, OVERBITE, TWO EYES THAT REALLY BUG / THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF MY HOMER-RIFFIC MUG / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, / I SHAVE IT CLOSE, TRIM HAIRS FROM MY NOSE / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, I CLEAN MY EARS, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I HEARS / I LIKE MY / I LIKE MY / I REALLY LIKE MY HOMER FACE
Homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!++++@++++There's the gap!
Oh man, Lisa's right -- none of these relationships lasted very long. Three days, one recess, half a field trip... why did I have to get so needy at the planetarium?++++@++++Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream.
Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?++++@++++Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.
Is that the only reason?++++@++++Well... I also keep things interesting.
All right, who took the microwave?++++@++++You see? Hey, what are you looking at?
I'd better switch to the hard stuff.++++@++++Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing.
Um, that's awesome. But I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me.++++@++++Hey, it's me.
Bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money...++++@++++...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus...
Well, don't buy 'em!++++@++++But they're playing the Purple Sox!
C'mon, Dad. You love New York. Now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.++++@++++Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?
Keep your meathooks off my sister Marge, or my goons will do a soft-shoe on your solar plexus.++++@++++You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!
Tough cookie, huh? Well, watch me take a bite out of you!++++@++++I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said "who!"
That's some lip ya got on ya. How'd you like me to stretch it like a rubber band and snap ya into last week?++++@++++You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach.
Homer, that sounds like "The Sweet Smell of Success".++++@++++It didn't feel like success.
We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.++++@++++Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses.
But don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?++++@++++I didn't say I swapped our house.
Fievel was a mouse in a movie.++++@++++Yes, and now look at us. Only in America.
Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!++++@++++Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart.
Can't Dad take Bart while we seek out culture?++++@++++You do that.
I guess my search for true love is doomed.++++@++++You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream.
Keep my secret!++++@++++Why you little... where's that ice cream?
Just once I'd like your father to be on a JumboTron for something good.++++@++++Damn you and your fluted neck!
Can't move?++++@++++I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
Um... I've gotta go.++++@++++Go where?
I can't.++++@++++Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!
Thanks, man.++++@++++Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be.
Well at least it didn't end as bad as "Romeo and Juliet."++++@++++Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews.
Hey! I specifically said no critics! This is outrageous! Ooh, but they like me!++++@++++I hope you enjoyed the show tonight. And if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of.
The best submission will be animated and appear on the show!++++@++++Do we screw them on the credit?
Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog.++++@++++Two stray dogs?
It's a black hole!++++@++++That was gonna be my next guess!
Are you sure your next guess wasn't "three stray dogs?"++++@++++Maybe.
Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes.++++@++++Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H.
Guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!++++@++++Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!
Dad, don't pat it!++++@++++Why should--
Dad, that's creepy.++++@++++Sorry.
The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?++++@++++Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing?
Now what?++++@++++Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called "Magic Craphole Waste Removal," but it wasn't me.
Zune... Zune... Zune...++++@++++Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--
You tossed your car keys in my bean plant!++++@++++A hero.
Homer! Is that my camera?++++@++++Hero away!
Not with the camera on.++++@++++I turned it off.
Looks like the red light's on.++++@++++I swear, I am not filming.
I don't know, I don't know! I'm sure I don't know!++++@++++Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed.
Sir, whatever happens in this house, these cameras will pick it up.++++@++++Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre.
Not the favorite! Not the favorite!++++@++++Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy.
Three-way.++++@++++You, me and Marge?
Cinnamon.++++@++++Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind...
Cinnamon / Cinnamon / Cinnamon!++++@++++Cinnamon!
I'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!++++@++++Would you go to the prom with me?
Homie, the faucet is dripping.++++@++++I'll get right on it.
Homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?++++@++++I'm on it!
Are you going to fix the faucet or not?++++@++++For the third time this year, yes!
Darn car won't start.++++@++++Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.
Sir, the car is fine. Can I be straight with you? As a mechanic, I'm not totally qualified to judge mental health...++++@++++So, you're not totally unqualified.
I think the problem is in your wife's head. There's a psychological reason why she hates this car.++++@++++A reason? What could it be?
I'm sorry, but there's no diagnostic computer for the female mind.++++@++++Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth.
I don't do laundry or kiss boo-boos!++++@++++Umm... no thanks.
All right, I remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. I mean, I don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. With this car, we're basically saying no more babies!++++@++++No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings.
Homer, the reason I hate this car is... I think I want another baby!++++@++++An "on purpose" baby?
Homie, I want another baby.++++@++++What about... you know... "Stinky"?
Homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what I say?++++@++++Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.
My husband and I have been snuggling six ways from Sunday...++++@++++And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight.
I guess... that's that, then.++++@++++Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have.
Is everything okay over here?++++@++++Sorry guys. Private family moment.
Yeah. That's why I wrap my plums in tin foil every day.++++@++++Eh, nothing we can do.
You never told me about that.++++@++++It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.
Awww... Eww... Homie! We still have a chance!++++@++++I, uh, hope it's twins!
Ooh, a Christmas ornament museum! Can we stop?++++@++++Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball.
I can't believe we spent the whole day here.++++@++++And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.
Ooh, Homie, you've lost weight.++++@++++What's that, baby?
It sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.++++@++++Yeah, no kids to ruin it.
I thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.++++@++++Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda.
So, you don't want another baby? How long have you felt this way?++++@++++Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born.
Just yell across the house like you do everything else!++++@++++Okay, good, we're talking...
We're not talking!++++@++++Your phone just dialed me.
You were pocket-dialed!++++@++++Hey, the pocket wants what it wants.
Homer... Homer, this is the point where I really have to know what you want.++++@++++I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect.
Nice speech, but the last of your sample was just selected by another couple.++++@++++Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
Here, it's yours. We don't need it.++++@++++Well, I expected a little argument.
No, no, no, look in the mirror, that's your argument.++++@++++Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right.
Homer? How many samples did you sell?++++@++++Um... remember that Corvette I had?
I thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.++++@++++This is the worst pain imaginable!
Maybe there's enough Homer in the world for now.++++@++++But I was really looking forward to...
Enjoy the film, you two!++++@++++Another thing that would be harder with four kids.
Homer! Dr. Hibbert told you to eat healthier!++++@++++I don't recall that.
I paid him to build a shed! Where is my shed, Bernice?++++@++++One onion rings, please.
Mr. Simpson, your injury was no accidÃ©nte, it was... negligÃ©nce.++++@++++My burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, I talk about how much money I'm going to make from the lawsuit.
They have healed much too quickly. Sit still while I give your head the "third degree."++++@++++Oh God! It hurts worse than the burns!
So, uh, what are you gonna do with the money, Homer?++++@++++Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa.
So where's the money now?++++@++++I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up.
Yeah, when you give the bank your money, they lend it to other people! I saw a Sesame Street about it! Kermit was wearing his trench coat and everything!++++@++++Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?
All the frogs on that show are Kermit. Keeps all the other frog actors out of work.++++@++++That settles it. No banks for me.
I'll tell you where you should put your money. The one safe place left in this world of woe:++++@++++What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!++++@++++A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?
You put my college fund on a poker site?!++++@++++It's a classy operation. See, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. Cute.
Well... at least I have a college fund!++++@++++On a poker site!
More importantly it's a college fund...++++@++++On a poker site!
Dad, please!++++@++++Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.
Where'd you get that shirt?++++@++++I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened.
Another way is don't drink.++++@++++I'm not Superman.
Homie! Do you know what yesterday was?++++@++++Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?
Yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit Grampa!++++@++++What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!
I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.++++@++++Marge, you take that back!
Fine, he'll be around forever.++++@++++You take that back!
I'm very sorry to tell you your father... is missing.++++@++++Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?
There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. Spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy...++++@++++Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum.
Grampa's army footlocker! I bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!++++@++++So precious...
The place that changed my life?++++@++++Flimsy lead, take me away!
We don't like questions, man.++++@++++I'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter, or an undercover cop...
What'd he say about a cop?++++@++++Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?
Welcome to Spiro's! I am Spiro. Not the Spiro on the sign -- that's my brother.++++@++++Did you say my dad worked here?
Napas To Thailo Valka!++++@++++Wait a minute!
Got it. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.++++@++++Now, what was that singer's name again?
Rita Lafleur.++++@++++Rita La-what?
Lafleur.++++@++++One more time.
I'll write it down for you.++++@++++Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
There's exactly one Rita Lafleur living in Springfield!++++@++++That's where we live!
Homer, she's married to your Dad!++++@++++Woo hoo! I get two Christmases!
You never looked up to him.++++@++++Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now.
Well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain.++++@++++But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!
Faster than you'd think...++++@++++I was alive when my Dad knew you?
I love men on the rebound. They always think they've done something wrong and they usually come with furniture.++++@++++My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!
We got married in the city hall across from the prettiest church you've ever seen. Then tragedy struck.++++@++++Hey, I'm startin' to remember why I don't remember so much.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you find your father. If you find him, tell him I can still do this. Yeah.++++@++++Holy moly.
And tell him to put on a splash of this.++++@++++That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.
When I knew him, it was young-man musk.++++@++++Man, you're making me hot for my Dad.
Only place in town that still sells Chicory Mist. After people found out it's ninety-eight percent squirrel sweat, they sorta stopped buying.++++@++++Listen, do you know this man?
Oh, I know him. He's a man who has no son!++++@++++Dad!
Abe, we were so worried.++++@++++Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again.
I didn't wander off, ya big fat salami! I ran away!++++@++++What?!
Grampa, we will never miss a visit again. And there'll be a lot more of them.++++@++++And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox.
Well... when you put it that way... all right. I can't say all is forgiven, but most is forgotten.++++@++++Aww.
Don't take Grampa's meds!++++@++++I'm payin' for 'em.
MY HEART DOES THE TWO-STEP WHEN YOU WALTZ IN THE PLACE / YEAH, MY TICKER BEATS QUICKER WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR FACE / YEAH YOU'D BETTER CALL THE DOCTOR BEFORE WE EMBRACE!++++@++++That's how wolves die in the wild.
It's beautiful!++++@++++The day my Frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...
I know this music! It was a Bugs Bunny!++++@++++What I wouldn't give for an anvil to fall on me.
Sh! Here comes Lisa's solo!++++@++++A perfect storm?
Well, well, if it isn't Mr. "Work Comes Before Bowling."++++@++++I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face.
LISA EATS BU-UGS...++++@++++Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
Lisa... would you like some shrimp?++++@++++Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?
Sorry, sorry. First of all, hi.++++@++++Hi... Dan.
Secondly, remember when you asked who I worked for, and I wouldn't say? I'm a mob boss! I'm running Fat Tony's gang while he's on jury duty!++++@++++Doodie.
Homer, that's not the shocking part.++++@++++Oh?
He wants me to kill a bunch of guys! I've got a gun! Look!++++@++++Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?
No! I want you to stop me from doing it!++++@++++You wha?
I want to do it, Homer. It's the ultimate business model!++++@++++In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.
Everything's led to this. I remember the first time I fired someone face to face. I cried. I cried! Saved the tear.++++@++++Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.
They fired me for not being tough! I had learned that in order to succeed, you must disregard the dangerous distraction of being human. And it brought me here. You scratch a businessman and you get a coldblooded killer. Well I've been scratched!++++@++++This is how I get out of doing the dishes.
I hate that expression! So overused!++++@++++Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!
Yeah! That's right! Tie 'em tighter! Mmm! Oh, that's good! Oh, that burns!++++@++++Could you please not sound like you like it so much?
Sorry, I'm into a lot of weird stuff.++++@++++Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you.
I really think that's coming from our house.++++@++++Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
Homer, pay attention!++++@++++That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!
How 'bout the Disney Minority Program?++++@++++Now how would you qualify for that?
I'm the son of an oaf.++++@++++Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.
Now turn around and get on your knees.++++@++++Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
No. I just know it takes you so long to get up I'll have plenty of time to escape.++++@++++I'll fix that later!
There's a great one, but you'll never get it outta me!++++@++++On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!
You think you're so smart, Alex Trebek. I remember when you were Alphonse Trebagoogoo.++++@++++Stop!
How do you keep finding me?++++@++++You really should tweet less.
But everyone deserves to know what I'm thinking all the time.++++@++++Just listen. If you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are.
I don't think so. They've killed a lot of people. And they tell their wives they're working, but they're really just hanging out.++++@++++Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. Give it to me!
Aw, I can't kill you.++++@++++I knew you were weak.
If you think I'm so weak, give me back the gun.++++@++++You are weak, but no.
Let's see how weak I am with the gun.++++@++++No, I don't want to.
Give me the gun.++++@++++I don't want to see it!
I'm not, you wanna, I'm not weak with the gun!++++@++++Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now.
If I have a gun, I'm not weak at all!++++@++++Well, you ain't so--
While you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house.++++@++++Marge, in a crisis like this, I need time for quiet contemplation.
What's wrong, Homer? You've got an expression on your face I ain't never seen before. Like one of them Charlie Brown wiggle-frowns.++++@++++I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death.
Ooh, someone is down in the Duff!++++@++++Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer.
Janette, Cheryl, get your own ride home.++++@++++Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?
You're coming with us to the school fundraiser.++++@++++Can this day get any worse?
The dog's got the mumps.++++@++++Dogs can't get mumps.
I bought you a ticket for the MyPad raffle, Dad.++++@++++Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money down the drain, sweetie. I never win anything. It's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of.
And the winner is...++++@++++Here it comes...
...Homer Simpson!++++@++++Get him! I mean, woo hoo!
Greetings, I am Steve Mobbs, welcoming you from beyond the grave.++++@++++I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
Submit.++++@++++I don't wanna.
Or you could buy something from Hewlett Packard.++++@++++I submit! I submit!
That adult Etch-A-Sketch certainly has brightened your mood.++++@++++Oh yeah!
Here ya go, Homer. Boy, y'know, when you're just here alone, I can really smell ya.++++@++++But I'm not alone. I'm doing some Face Time with Lenny.
Put that down! We're being audited!++++@++++The old stupid moustache'll win him over.
Is that the MyPad you're claiming as a business expense?++++@++++I'm standing by that.
Put down your MyPad and get back to work.++++@++++Sorry, boss.
Awesome!++++@++++Woo hoo!
Dad, I'm walking on my hands, and the lions think they're gonna eat me!++++@++++Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get "Churro-Chaser" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?
Dad, pay attention to your children!++++@++++Okay.
Homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.++++@++++What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?
Hm, I guess you're right. I guess I'll have to scratch that off the list of things I say.++++@++++Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, "Krusty's Kosher Karnival"..."Words With Enemies"..."Don't Burn the Toast!", "Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break," ooh, "Pizza Clock"!
Homer, you're gonna be fine. But there's no hope for the MyPad.++++@++++It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
This is the part of the job I hate most. Talking to crazy people.++++@++++Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Homer! Homer! It's a miracle!++++@++++Keep your pants on, Flanders.
Oh, I will! Till I go to bed and take 'em off under the covers! But come outside and see the miracle!++++@++++Has the MyPad risen?
Here it is. The Holy Ooze.++++@++++This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop.
Look a little closer.++++@++++Huh. "Hope." Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?
Well... I like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles I could mention. Passover.++++@++++Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?
Don't eat the miracle!++++@++++Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
Huh. Looks like you're really turning somethin' over in your mind there, Homer.++++@++++Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!
Here you go. Duff Adequate.++++@++++To hope!
Of all the gifts the Lord gives us, perhaps the greatest is hope...++++@++++Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope.
Homie? Aren't you going to come in?++++@++++I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?
Don't call Satan! So what if the message wasn't a miracle? The answer isn't in syrup from God or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real.++++@++++Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain.
Homie, you have such a way with foods. Let's go inside.++++@++++Who do you think painted the word on the tree?
No idea. The important thing is that they did.++++@++++Guess it must've been the person who knew I needed hope most of all.
What a lucky little boy to get a trip to the park with his grandpa.++++@++++Grampa?!
Oh my God! Should I call an ambulance? Help! An old man is dying!++++@++++This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me.
What about "thunderbags?"++++@++++Get lost, pervs!
Nine one one. What is your emergency?++++@++++I'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.
"But, Chief, the power lines." Go lower!++++@++++No, no, nothing, nope.
Sorry gents, we're fresh out. I only make one batch a day, and when they're gone, I'm done.++++@++++No more donuts?
Tell you what... I could give you a sneak preview of a new donut that's still in the R & D phase.++++@++++Beer keg do-nut?
I'm Terence.++++@++++Tell me everything about you.
Yeah, but Portland just got too played out. The city used to be real. Did you know there are now restaurants there with two locations? Not near my kids.++++@++++Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!
You can't let being a dad slow you down. Me and the fam are doing the whole "urban nomad" thing, you know, just looking for an undiscovered city with affordable houses.++++@++++Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.
What a find! Underneath all the ugly renovations, this house has Neutra bones.++++@++++In my house, we found human bones.
Thanks for turning us on to this place, Homer. You're a pretty cool guy.++++@++++Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?
Relax, kids, just be yourselves.++++@++++Great, Marge, now that's in their heads.
Hey, this is my armadillo, Chewy. "Mexico" Chewy, not "Star Wars" Chewy.++++@++++"Star Wars" Chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary.
Neighbors, I get it.++++@++++"T-Rex?" Even their names are cool! This is, umm... Ice Cream, Bungee Jump, and... Viral Video.
Homer, I think we should go. We're not like these people.++++@++++Check out my new look!
You're all bald!++++@++++No, I'm young person "cool" bald, not old person "sad" bald. I never want to see these again.
To be honest, that comes as a tremendous relief.++++@++++Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back.
Maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. You know, we might not all be a perfect match.++++@++++I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end.
Well sweetie, if it's that important to you, I guess we can try.++++@++++Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip.
The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!++++@++++No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--
Parenting shouldn't have a style! Parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! Are you wearing a wallet chain?! You look like... a barista!++++@++++Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches.
And what's with the scarf? It's soaked in neck sweat.++++@++++Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. The. Essence.
Made? Why didn't you just buy him a toy?++++@++++Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a "toy" from the "store," like we would give "our kids," then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!
Yeah, this factory used to make blimp tires.++++@++++T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
Your son attacked mine! You've turned this former slaughterhouse into a place of violence!++++@++++I thought it made blimp tires!
It's time for you guys to leave.++++@++++Are we still on for midnight bike riding?
Have you been "oh boy"-ing all night?++++@++++O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.
Look. That kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!++++@++++He called me... a poser?
Yeah, I was sticking up for you.++++@++++You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.
Also, I didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because I don't breastfeed!++++@++++What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
I want my moustache stencils back.++++@++++Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!
I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from "The Feud Network" to "Comity Central."++++@++++Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?
I like him. He talks in rhyme and owns a whimsical store in a failing mall. He's like the dad in a Wes Anderson movie.++++@++++Shut up with your names!
Well, we were just questioning the parenting that led to Bart not using his words with Tyrannosaurus.++++@++++Parenting? Let me tell you "cool parents" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!
Yes, but there's two sides to every--++++@++++Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave.
We're not going anywhere. Our house just got written up in "Dwell."++++@++++Oh no, it's true!
The cool people are everywhere! Somehow they've even made the weather rainier!++++@++++I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!
Disco Stu has found a new thing!++++@++++What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!
The net of scarves and wallet chains is holding!++++@++++They're necessary! They're necessary!
I've labeled all his boxes!++++@++++Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt.
You know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt!++++@++++Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!
Fine. Just stay here and hold down the fort.++++@++++Hold down the fort?! With my bad back?!
Maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.++++@++++You're back!
Did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?++++@++++It's real to them!
Um... where's Santa's Little Helper?++++@++++I don't know -- the back yard?
I don't see him anywhere. You jackass! You lost our dog!++++@++++Oh my God. I forgot to feed my jackass!
Hank-hew!++++@++++You're hel-come!
What the hell?++++@++++Oh, right.
The animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. Just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon.++++@++++A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?
We don't want a raccoon.++++@++++Good, Marge. Get their price down.
Hey, Lisa's right. You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog.++++@++++Not a crier.
What?! You cry all the time! You cried when they canceled that show you hated.++++@++++Goofing on it made me feel wise!
And he didn't pee on the floor!++++@++++Prep, prep, prep...
I'll answer that: your father's an idjit!++++@++++I believe the word is idiote.
How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?++++@++++I know what must have happened:
Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?++++@++++He knows I love him. And he loves me.
You never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. And I suspect you've been chewing on his treats.++++@++++How are they his treats if I paid for them?
Really? What about Bongo?++++@++++Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
Bongo was Homer's dog when he was a boy.++++@++++He's still my dog!
We got him years ago...++++@++++I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?++++@++++It doesn't make sense to me!
Well, tell us your version.++++@++++Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say...
Well I guess I could always drop a horse on a church afterward... fine.++++@++++Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
Yeah, but at least it was short.++++@++++Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo...
Hendrix! C'mere, boy!++++@++++But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for...
Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.++++@++++Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made.
A Christmas card I got from Miss Viola years later.++++@++++He still has my sweatshirt.
Bongo didn't forget you. Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away. They were fickle as Hell.++++@++++Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now.
All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.++++@++++Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?
Aw, give me a hug, son.++++@++++Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.
Hold your arms like you're carrying a wedding cake!++++@++++What flavor?
It doesn't matter!++++@++++If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers.
C'mon, boy. Time to go to bed.++++@++++My dog.
"Learn Zone?" Mom, you said we were going someplace fun.++++@++++Yeah, Mom, you promised!
Homer, I told you, don't call me "Mom."++++@++++Sorry, Mrs. Simpson.
For maximum safety, all children must wear anti-kidnapping bracelets.++++@++++Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?++++@++++Feed it to the dog.
You'd have to wrap cheese around it.++++@++++Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
Keep an eye on the kids, Homer.++++@++++Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.
Bart and Lisa.++++@++++It's always my kids.
What's hopeless?++++@++++Who the hell are you?
Dad! / Come up! / Pretty please! / Come up!++++@++++Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!
Only wanted... to be fun...++++@++++Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace.
We tricked you! / Eat Nerf, Homeboy!++++@++++Real matuuure!
Get out of there, you!++++@++++Never!
It means "without the rule of law." Anarchy. The end of civilization. Coming soon to an America near you.++++@++++America can't collapse! We're as powerful as ancient Rome!
The modern world. An inexorable march of progress.++++@++++Sweet.
The man who is prepared.++++@++++Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!
Homer, meet the Springfield Preppers.++++@++++Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys! Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!
Not "preppies," "prepp-ers." But I like your hatred.++++@++++It's based on nothing!
A burst of radiation that knocks out every electrical system in the country.++++@++++I'd slash my wrists! But how, without my electric knife?!
There is an alternative to suicide.++++@++++I can't conceive of any.
All we ask is that you keep your prepping secret. We won't have room for all the unprepared.++++@++++Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.
When grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about.++++@++++Just go play your saxophone while you can.
What does that mean?++++@++++Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!
When things go south, the "sheeple" will clean out every supermarket in town.++++@++++Typical sheeple.
Are you eating my grain?++++@++++Maybe.
That was a five-pound bag!++++@++++Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?
Hey, Dad. Are we going camping?++++@++++I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
What's up? Going crazy again?++++@++++I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies.
Guys who call themselves "preacher" or "deacon" are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves.++++@++++Hollywood has taught you well, my son. Now let's push "play."
Fridge-ra-torrs! Fridge-ra-torrs!++++@++++Fridge-ra-torr!
Aren't they just saying "refrigerator?"++++@++++Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.
Here it is, Homer. The Springfield Preppers' top secret Bug-Out Retreat.++++@++++Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.
There's always one alarmist. Anyway, when the Four Horsemen ride, we want you and your collaterals right here with us.++++@++++Aw. Uh, listen, I've gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?
Well, that is a big part of it.++++@++++It's okay. I know what I am.
I can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush...++++@++++Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.
What move? We haven't moved! What's going on?!++++@++++I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.
You can't have secrets from your wife!++++@++++It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
I thought the basement looked cleaner.++++@++++See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.
Survive what?++++@++++The looming kablooey.
It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. But this is all a little... creepy.++++@++++Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon.
The end of the world as we know it?++++@++++Uh-huh, where's the kids?
Lisa and Maggie are downstairs, and Bart's in his room with Milhouse.++++@++++Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever.
Is that sax alto or baritone?++++@++++Baritone.
Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? We're already bored.++++@++++Here's something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
Homie, I never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble.++++@++++Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me.
No one was laughing. You kept it a secret!++++@++++Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own.
How can you call yourself a Christian?++++@++++If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
Boom.++++@++++Why do we have to shoot them at all?
Are you that good with a knife?++++@++++No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!
Every time you wake us up early in the morning, it's either church or we have to change our identities.++++@++++Don't be silly, "Mary Ellen."
I've got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.++++@++++White rice or brown?
Good boy.++++@++++So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.
You said you cut the wires to the alarm!++++@++++Hm. I cut the wires to something.
Dad, there are lights following us!++++@++++How can that be? I took every last can of gas!
Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood.++++@++++You got to watch a VHS copy of "Red Dawn" thirteen times. Stop complaining.
And this goes too.++++@++++Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest.
Mannequin heads, you're working for me now.++++@++++Lotta people at the dump today.
Well, sir, the Lord wouldn't have placed His meter there if He didn't want me to park.++++@++++This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!
Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks.++++@++++We're cool, right boy?
Nothing a few George Washingtons won't solve.++++@++++Now to sleep the sleep of the just.
You know what they do to parking meter thieves in prison? They probably treat 'em pretty well. But when you get out, you're not eligible for jury duty. Which again, sounds pretty good.++++@++++Eat silver, copper!
A pillowcase full of quarters?! Where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!++++@++++The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did.
Well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!++++@++++Woo hoo!
And I hope Bart passes his test and saves the school.++++@++++Way to get us back on topic, Marge.
Hey, Homer! We were just doin' a little storm chasing.++++@++++Lenny, take us with you to find our dog! It's okay, Marge, they're professionals.
I'd say she's prettier than a surface hoar.++++@++++Hey!
--the sublimation of ice crystals that's colder than the frost point?++++@++++Maybe the last words I'll ever write.
I'll tell you what women really want: a man who can hold a note the longest.++++@++++That is the stupidest...
Homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me.++++@++++I would never do that.
Enough with the singing!++++@++++Fine. But I swear: I will win you back from Lenny.
It's gone!++++@++++Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?
Oh my God! The twister got Carl, my best friend in the world! I can barely remember what he looks like.++++@++++He was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.
Are you pushing?++++@++++Yes, it won't give!
Except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job.++++@++++Found another one.
Mom, I am so glad you're alive.++++@++++Were you worried about me, boy?
Oh yeah, I'm a wreck.++++@++++Stop being blasÃ©!
Never!++++@++++Now I know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. Just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes.
Homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. The kids could end up wards of the state.++++@++++Connecticut?
No, our state.++++@++++Okay, you're right. It's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but I think the choice is obvious -- my dad.
You'd let me have another chance after the way I screwed things up with you?++++@++++Good point. We'll find somebody else.
Yup, you're a big bag of blubber soaked in worthless juice.++++@++++I got it, Dad.
Why I married you I'll never know.++++@++++Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich.
Sugar?++++@++++Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please.
And no resenting us ever!++++@++++That's some impressive flute-nastics.
Didn't you want to ask us something?++++@++++Goodbye forever!
Someone's cranky.++++@++++All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get.
With nametags on them?++++@++++Kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family.
Oh, I see. You guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night, rolls over, and crushes mom.++++@++++This is not that! And that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!
Homer! Dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!++++@++++Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole "meet cute" thing going.
Maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass.++++@++++Wait! What about that couple? They look pretty cozy.
Just for standing on a thing?++++@++++Wowww. Your house is perfect. No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool Grampa...
I love two things: shutting up and giving away money.++++@++++Ooh, Thanks, Dad.
It's a promise stone. It signifies that if I ever get to be a burden, I just jump in a volcano.++++@++++Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another.
With you guys? Uh... seems like my husband would be getting the much better deal.++++@++++No, no, no. I meant pushing kids on swings.
Give me a minute to get some images out of my mind.++++@++++Okay, take whatever time you need. I just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians.
Babe, when a killer wave hits, you can't spend your whole life deciding if you want to drop in or not. It just might be the most righteous tube we ever shot.++++@++++Man, you sure can talk surfer talk.
Okay, we'll give some serious thought to taking them.++++@++++Maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
It's empty.++++@++++You never know when you might wanna mail something.
Homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?++++@++++Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.
But we know so little about them.++++@++++I swear to you, Marge, when I have the time, I will Google them both.
Hey, where's Bart?++++@++++Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying...
I still have my uses!++++@++++Name another.
Well, I must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of.++++@++++Now I can finally complete my bucket list.
Homer, Marge... we have a favor to ask.++++@++++Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more.
A whole weekend? I don't know...++++@++++Hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend.
I guess. As long as we don't make it a habit.++++@++++Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit.
Do you have to do that in front of people?++++@++++It helps me write.
...so you will obey.++++@++++I don't like the way they just rip the paper off. Santa's Little Helper my ass.
Oh God! They want to steal our kids!++++@++++No one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that I never told you about... except I guess I just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!
That's why they took our kids so quick.++++@++++Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young.
She's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.++++@++++Oh yeah, man.
Homie, I just had a horrible thought.++++@++++Women and their horrible thoughts.
What if they are better for the kids than us?++++@++++Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.
Homer, Marge... I understand your anger, but your kids are more awesome than the breaks at Waimea.++++@++++Those better be good breaks.
Honestly, we fell in love with 'em and it seemed like you guys didn't really want 'em.++++@++++Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?
Like clockwork.++++@++++Well, I'm glad someone has.
Kids, your father and I have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians.++++@++++Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.
If you call this living.++++@++++Why you little...
Win what?++++@++++I forget.
Turn right onto First Street, head east. Homer, watch the road! Not this road, the other road!++++@++++Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!
Switching to male voice...++++@++++Finally! A supervisor!
Mary?++++@++++Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
Bart Simpson, I don't know what the future holds for you...++++@++++If you're lucky, me, then this.
Ew! On every level! Ew! Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of Milhice. What? It's the plural of Milhouse. Look it up.++++@++++Listen to your sister, boy.
What I'm saying applies to you too, Dad.++++@++++What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.
Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?++++@++++It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?
Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate.++++@++++How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
More like balder and wider.++++@++++Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!
I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!++++@++++You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.++++@++++I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
All right. Fine. If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think.++++@++++Finally, we're gettin' somewhere.
You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog.++++@++++Hand me my suitcase, boy.
When do I get a Krusty suitcase?++++@++++When you're older.
So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out?++++@++++You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?
We'll get right on it, Mr. Simpson.++++@++++I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!
What's this notice on the wall?++++@++++Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
Aw, man! We just missed it.++++@++++Oh, it'll happen again, son.
Um, I've gotta make a phone call.++++@++++Knock yourself out.
MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, NOW I SEE HIS WARTS / I WISH HIM WELL, DOWN IN HELL, WHERE HE'LL EAT HIS OWN SHORTS! It just poured out of me, like venom from a snake!++++@++++I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
Or getting her kid hooked on pot. She's my kid too, you know.++++@++++You know what we need? A classic "kicked outta the house" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?
I've got the audio book of Robert Caro's "The Passage of Power."++++@++++That's it? Well, then let's "power" this party up!
I miss Roxie. That's the club where I used to smoke pot with my kid.++++@++++This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.
But how do we figure out what to do?++++@++++The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!
Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.++++@++++Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture.
Hear hear!++++@++++After we finish watching the movie.
DAD, DON'T BE A CREDIT HOG++++@++++THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN
I'LL STOP EATING FROM THE GARBAGE++++@++++MARGE YOU WILL GET THE LAST PORK CHOP...
A completed chore list!++++@++++And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.
Dad, what are you watching?++++@++++I think it's a Terence Malick movie.
No, you're watching Baby Poindexter, the most educational DVD available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!++++@++++Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles.
Homer, a little help?++++@++++I'm on it.
Sorry, folks. She doesn't even work here.++++@++++Spot the Hidden Objects.
Have you seen Lisa and Maggie?++++@++++If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then "no."
Homie, help me find them.++++@++++Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.
Dad, why are you kowtowing to Mr. Van Houten?++++@++++Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.
Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.++++@++++Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?
Homer, that's for children!++++@++++Where does it say that?
Read the rest of the title!++++@++++Highlights... "for..."
I lost my other earring.++++@++++Leave it to me...
Wondered where that was.++++@++++...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
Can you find anything you like in this bed?++++@++++Just my honey pie.
Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens, but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here. They've disappeared!++++@++++We'll get those kids back.
Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?++++@++++How many kids will jazz corrupt?
Homie, do you see anything?++++@++++No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.
When I said you needed a software update, it was not a criticism.++++@++++We've found what we're looking for.
The kids?++++@++++Sure, they could be here. Who knows?
The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.++++@++++Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!
He's ten years old!++++@++++There's always a catch.
Is anyone here gonna buy a condo?!++++@++++It's gonna be "yes," but don't rush me.
I sure hope not.++++@++++Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
Hmm, you're right. It is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted TV shows.++++@++++Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs.
This is... "Storage Battles."++++@++++I'll give it one marathon.
Skinner!++++@++++No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!
I want to know what it's for.++++@++++Too late!
It looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.++++@++++There's other P.O.s? Uh-oh, better put on my game shades.
Six-fifty going once, six-fifty going twice...++++@++++One thousand dollars!
One-thousand-dollars-going-once-going-twice-sold-to-the-man-who-didn't-wait-for-the-bidding-to-get-anywhere-near-one-thousand-dollars!++++@++++In the money game, cash is king.
We spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?++++@++++You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
I wasn't laughing -- I was being worried.++++@++++Feather boas?
Makeup and baby oil!++++@++++Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
Property of Abraham J. Simpson? This is Grampa's stuff!++++@++++Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
It's not all lady stuff. Look at all these fitness publications.++++@++++Beefcake mags?
I think your dad might be gay.++++@++++That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.
I think this is great! Old gay men are adorable! Like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.++++@++++Those are pretty cute...
Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year.++++@++++My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.
Oh Homie, you're so... enlightened.++++@++++Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby.
Abe... we found your storage locker.++++@++++It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you.
Help me out of the closet! Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.++++@++++No fatties!
How about some fatties?++++@++++Fine.
I hope someone saw our ad.++++@++++If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son.
What?! I don't ride side-saddle! I'm straight as a submarine!++++@++++Then how do you explain this?
You're Glamorous Godfrey!++++@++++Who?
All right, I'll tell ya... It was the 1950s...++++@++++Those things?
Excellent. So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.++++@++++I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
I'll bring you home my dessert.++++@++++Text me the choices.
"Gorilla Joe," "Gorilla Sam," "Gorilla Pete," "Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins"... Where did Mr. Burns dig up all these old wrestlers?++++@++++Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God.
Can I have one! Can I?++++@++++Fine.
Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!++++@++++Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!
Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!++++@++++Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?
Burnsy, I can't remember the last time I was so happy.++++@++++You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your "number one fan" did at show and tell!
Who would film such a thing?++++@++++It's found footage!
So what! We could use another winner in this family.++++@++++How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
Wrestle with Bart? He ain't beefy, but he is infuriating and you can't teach infuriating. Monty, you're a genius!++++@++++Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!
Why are you so mean to me?++++@++++He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!
Oh, that was so sweet.++++@++++I wish Grampa was my dad.
Goes with the sugar!++++@++++Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way.
Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?++++@++++Are your kids gonna be there?
Eh, for a little bit.++++@++++Okay.
Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!++++@++++Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress.
There's no emergency here! And please charge us for the false report! I'm going out for a power walk.++++@++++This room just got a whole lot cooler.
Homer! I can't believe you're partaking with my parents!++++@++++Yeah, it's medicinal. We had a pain in our neck.
Homer... you'll need to wear this eye patch for a couple weeks... and you may never see a film in 3-D again.++++@++++But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
Not praying to a character in a comic book.++++@++++What about Christian Archie comics?
Neither canonical nor comical.++++@++++Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod...
Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now. More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings.++++@++++Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge.
My what?++++@++++Your famous murmur. You know .
Nix! She's already got two weeks tenure so she's impossible to dislodge.++++@++++I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job.
Homer, that's you.++++@++++Oh yeah. I say "union" you say "power"! Union...
Power.++++@++++Union!
We should talk about what we're going to promise to do, not what we'll actually do.++++@++++We really appreciate that.
Homer. Homer! I found the answer!++++@++++Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.
"Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth..."++++@++++Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!
I would embrace such a glad visit!++++@++++Just what do you want?!
I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew.++++@++++So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive.
Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!++++@++++C'mon, man. What's the catch?
Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. Punch me.++++@++++Hmm...
What's this about a fisting?++++@++++I'm not punching you, Flanders.
What? Why?!++++@++++Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels.
No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!++++@++++It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!
Now, there's no need to...++++@++++Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!
Enough!++++@++++You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man.
Now you're rhyming?!++++@++++I didn't know you were left-handed.
...which Wikipedia defines as a strong, resilient water-resistant material. That definition is a hit with no errors!++++@++++What's wrong, Sweetie?
My teacher's still bullying me.++++@++++Even after we came to school?
That just made it worse.++++@++++Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!
My prayers have been answered! Well actually, just this one.++++@++++But, there is one condition...
Now you can shatter my orbital bone! That'll knock the wax off my candle!++++@++++Don't wanna hit you. I want your wife.
There's only one way: the nuclear option.++++@++++How much plutonium do you want? Gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it.
How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?++++@++++This is praying?! Let me outta here!
You guys, I swear I didn't do it.++++@++++I don't like the sound of that funeral march.
Forget the candy! We're here to turn this...into this!++++@++++Now do me wearing a sombrero!
Wow -- he passed the Maggie test. And remember how Maggie solved Cookiegate?++++@++++All too well.
I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of "Rubber v. Glue" and reaffirmed by "I Know You Are v. What Am I."++++@++++Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! It's so frickin' boring! Run, boy! I'll create a distraction!
Will the defendant please rise?++++@++++It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.
Let me guess: is it Marge?++++@++++Her husband's gonna be there too.
Got it. You and Marge.++++@++++Give up? It's Marge -- I'm having a lunch date with my wife.
Good one. / Yeah, you got us, man.++++@++++Date with my wife.
This is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! It got three-and-a-half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide!++++@++++When we got married I promised you a life full of romance. Now here it is.
Tip included!++++@++++Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others.
So without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.++++@++++Oh yeah.
Uh, I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons.++++@++++Beats drowning.
I think I'm interesting!++++@++++What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?
Can you chew with your mouth closed? It's like looking into a garbage disposal.++++@++++Words hurt, you know.
The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.++++@++++Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus.
That usually works, but not today.++++@++++Uh-oh.
Lousy.++++@++++You can't spell "lousy" without "us."
I'm going to take a cab.++++@++++Marge, wait!
I'm not going to sleep!++++@++++Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.
For a man confronted with danger, two responses immediately come to mind.++++@++++I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!
What are you doing home from work?++++@++++I'm fightin' for ya, babe. Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. And to show you how serious I am...
From the gas station?++++@++++From the place beside the gas station!
No! I'm tired of your broken promises! "Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds." "Sweetie, I'll be home at eight p.m." "Sweetie, I'll be home at eight a.m." "I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life." I'm done!++++@++++Marge was so happy when I made those promises. What changed?
Meanwhile, Homer was doing something very difficult for him -- thinking.++++@++++How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed.
Fortunately, the modern man has a third alternative.++++@++++Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
There are... fourteen... taco Joes in your area.++++@++++That was yesterday.
Yesterday by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.++++@++++Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?
Bart! Milhouse!++++@++++Okay, let's see how straight it is.
Guess who's coming to dinner!++++@++++What have I told you about comical entrances?
This list is from six years ago.++++@++++Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?
What fish may I deplete from our oceans for your passing pleasure? Perhaps some shark fin soup? Whale tonsils? Baby dolphin blowhole? Turtle smile?++++@++++I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make.
You want omakase: chef's choice.++++@++++You're all I have left. I trust you completely.
And I you. Let me run your credit card to celebrate that trust.++++@++++Okay... this should do it.
I see tears in your toro.++++@++++Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
I say marriage is like fish. There are parts so delicious they could've been sliced from angels...and parts we make into omakase.++++@++++Omakase? Where have I heard that word before?
Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that. I've been readin' that "Fifty Shades of Grey" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give 'em what-for in the bedroom there.++++@++++Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!
Well, are you comfortable with role play?++++@++++I think I could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. Bob's your uncle.
Mmm... new cushion smell!++++@++++Oh Marge! Come to the ga-rage! You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!
What does this do?++++@++++Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!
This is not putting me in the mood!++++@++++Anger's a mood!
Why would you think I'd like this?++++@++++I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
Huh. That was just a placebo.++++@++++What does that mean?
Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine.++++@++++It's behind the Dingle Swing.
Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. And there's nothing a woman loves more than that.++++@++++Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?
Actually I'm cool with one of them.++++@++++Which one?
Not gonna say.++++@++++What size batteries.
D.++++@++++Ooh! How many?
Sixteen.++++@++++Holy moly!
It sure has taken a beating over the years. Might be time to get a new one...++++@++++Really? You wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
Are there any two words more exciting than "couch shopping?"++++@++++No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
But they let me take fabric samples!++++@++++They charged a deposit!
They had to! It came from corporate!++++@++++That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate.
The latest New York fashion has come to Springfield -- bedbugs!++++@++++Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.
It's making me see them!++++@++++The brain is so stupid.
How did we get bedbugs?++++@++++Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?
D'unno. Why are your friends such drunks?++++@++++TouchÃ©.
I don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!++++@++++Wait a minute! This has oats in it!
Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses.++++@++++Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't.
Homer, I love your passion. It's terrific, it's really something. Listen -- I'm just thinking -- would you consider being my deacon?++++@++++Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?
No, not at all. It's like a sexton, or a rector.++++@++++Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?
Because if I can get the man who sleeps through church to be my guy, this town will know that religion can be fun.++++@++++Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, "I'm your astronaut"!
Homer! You're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding!++++@++++Just looking for the bathroom.
This is not the bathroom!++++@++++But this paper towel feels so good.
Homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married.++++@++++That would save us several hundred bucks.
Tell her she's wrong!++++@++++Right, um, I don't understand, Lisa, we let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding!
Hey, I have a weakness for pomp!++++@++++Since when?
Uh, but first, let me introduce our new deacon... Homer Simpson!++++@++++It's an honor, sir.
You bring in the lost sheep and the others will follow.++++@++++Lost sheep! Yes! Sis boom bah!
Dad?! You always hated church!++++@++++Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself.
The only thing bigger than you, is you tomorrow.++++@++++Why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only God can do that...
We need guidance!++++@++++Son, I'd love to, but... I'm a deacon now. My butt's place is in my pants.
We've lost him.++++@++++What the--?
I have a plan -- save your civic leaders!++++@++++Calm yourselves! In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... Reverend Hooper.
His words have soothed the amphibious beasts!++++@++++His boringness saved us all...
Mom's deleting old TV shows off the DVR.++++@++++Marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few dis-as-ters.
Fine. What would you get rid of?++++@++++Well, I can't part with a single one of my "Hoarders"! Hands off my episodes of "Episodes," and if you delete "Revenge"...
...and that's why libraries use newspaper rods.++++@++++I know C.P.R.
Are you sure it wasn't "Stayin' Alive?"++++@++++Too on the nose. I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...
I BELIEVE IN YOUSE... you guys, you saved me! You do care!++++@++++Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you're okay. Who's the president now?
Some jerk.++++@++++He's back!
I sent you to the store to get applesauce for Maggie two hours ago!++++@++++Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident.
Yes. 'Cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer twenty years ago.++++@++++They're like a wedding ring, I can't take them off anymore.
No, it's a forty-four long -- I wear a thirty-eight hunched.++++@++++Got anything for a man my size?
Absolutely not. Tent City is across the street.++++@++++Tent, eh?
No husband of mine is wearing a tent!++++@++++No tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. Thank you, fashion police.
Now what say we turn the hot water on and off while your father's taking a shower.++++@++++Thank God I'm not in the shower!
So you're saying Moe's Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?++++@++++The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
Ah, Mr. Homer. I see you are wearing the bald man's beret.++++@++++Is it that obvious?
I'm as smooth as jazz.++++@++++My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.
What the? But I used the best label paste.++++@++++Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe.
Hey, come on, there's sexy bald like... uh... Babar, king of the elephants. I read his books as a kid. He married his cousin, Celeste. That was my takeaway.++++@++++Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it.
Hey, your baseball cap's one plastic bump tighter than usual. What gives?++++@++++Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald.
Yeah, you already landed a hot wife. That's the only reason men evolved hair.++++@++++What are you talking about?
You lured Marge in with your hair. You trapped her with marriage. You skinned and field-gutted her by having kids. Now she's mounted on your wall for good, with fake glass eyes and a rubber tongue.++++@++++The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not.
You sound seriously depressed. Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's?++++@++++It's not even noon.
I couldn't help overhearing your predicament. Mainly because my hearing is so great.++++@++++Who are you?
You'll need your voice to say "thanks, Mom" after your next recital!++++@++++Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay.
No, just a regular hairless Joe like you. Been bald since I was twenty-three. With the money I've saved I bought a yacht.++++@++++You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.
You wait for the right moment, you show her that glorious dome, and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom and let the kisses flow like rain.++++@++++Wow, is that what your wife did?
Listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you.++++@++++Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true.
Is it your impression of Mr. Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.++++@++++No, it's something else.
I always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!++++@++++Hair, no hair, I don't really think about it.
Confidence is so attractive in a man.++++@++++Tell me about it.
We take you now to doubles action between Pavlyuchenkeka-Vilnikova and Strakova-Mishtnupetrateva.++++@++++To me it's legs versus boobs.
Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!++++@++++What the hell is that?
Mom said we could watch it!++++@++++Did she really say that?
Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?++++@++++No.
Ki-Ya!++++@++++You like this now? What about "Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?"
So you didn't buy our weekly ticket?++++@++++Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.
Hey, it's time. Turn it on! Turn it on!++++@++++Four lucky numbers for four best friends.
My number's twenty-two. No reason. Just twenty-two.++++@++++And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why.
Guys, guys, we gotta celebrate! Throw a ragin' party! I'll cash the ticket, Homer, Homer, you get the food--++++@++++I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!
Who cares? We got the money! I'm so happy! I'm so happy!++++@++++To the best feeling in the world -- money.
I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.++++@++++Yeah, that's probably what happened.
I wonder what's keeping Carl?++++@++++I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.++++@++++I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
Carl's gone.++++@++++Our money's gone.
We've been betrayed -- by good ol' Carl!++++@++++Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL
Guys, give Carl a chance! I'm sure he's gonna come back!++++@++++I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
I bet he flew to Quebec to bring us back authentic French Canadian sugar pie. Oh, I can taste it already. "Mmm, thanks for the sugar pie, Carl."++++@++++Hey, what's this? "I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson."
I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings. I thought it would have been you, or you, or you.++++@++++I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over.
You don't know where Carl is from?++++@++++Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff.
Hey, hey, get that outta here! I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot-thief again!++++@++++Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
You're going so far away. I'll miss you.++++@++++Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?++++@++++I've already taken care of that.
Hey Lenny, when are you gonna wise up? Carl never wants to see us again! I'm done talkin' to you!++++@++++This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody.
Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our, friend... he's, uh, about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos...++++@++++Just say he's black, Moe.
Carl Carlson! His family has been hated for a thousand years.++++@++++How do you know about Carl's family?
Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say "HjorleifsstrÃ¦ti" across the butt.++++@++++The gates are locked.
Not to me.++++@++++Sorry, Lenny.
Hey, hey, hey, Lenny, forget him, forget him! Look, we still got the money.++++@++++What the hell is this?
Maybe we'd give it back to our friend, but we're not friends, remember?++++@++++Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass.
Hi, Homie! Did you get the money? The kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!++++@++++Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?++++@++++Well, we won't know that till after.
Just read the saga and see what it says.++++@++++But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?
Thorn?++++@++++Yes!
I can't do this! I CAN'T DO THIS!++++@++++You can't not do it!
Wow, Carl's family really was brave!++++@++++..."weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders.
Hey guys... I think I feel bad for Carl.++++@++++Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
The blood of a thousand tiny horses is on their hands!++++@++++It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.
Carl Carlson is our friend. Even if he doesn't believe it.++++@++++Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much.
Guys, thanks for teaching me the true meaning of male friendship: the stuff that comes from in here... that is guy stuff.++++@++++We don't get together to share our emotions. We get together to escape them.
What is it? What is it? What is it?++++@++++...keg-pools!
Our first anniversary.++++@++++And we're more in love than ever. In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!
Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp.++++@++++He's not your daddy.
Fat daddy smell like beer!++++@++++I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
Homer, you're the anchor store of my heart!++++@++++Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here.
Oh Homie, what a wonderful anniversary!++++@++++Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better...
Wait... you named me after a train?++++@++++Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that...
Memory loss! Could be a brain tumor! Take this and go see Fantasia!++++@++++Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!
Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?++++@++++She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
Try this.++++@++++You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
So I'm not babysitting tomorrow night?++++@++++Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.
Dad! Do we have to ride like this?++++@++++Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?
Hey Lardo! Where're you goin' in your Lardo car? Lardville?++++@++++There's no such place!
Hi, Homie! A crazy thing happened when I was ordering your anniversary gift.++++@++++Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?
Yes. And it's a big one. Remember?++++@++++Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. "Laser." That's a funny word. It's just "loser" with an "a." And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--
He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.++++@++++Currently: zero.
I know what it's like not to be listened to. Please ignore every sensible instinct you have and continue this conversation. And by the way, this is my real voice.++++@++++Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back.
Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until four a.m.++++@++++Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?
What? Where're your going? I--++++@++++Um, Marge, I have to go.
Well, we could... live blog it.++++@++++I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...
Why are you singing that?++++@++++Because it's in the public domain?
Hello! It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.++++@++++Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!
Then keep quiet like a cabbage!++++@++++All right, all right, I'll be right there!
That's great. I wonder what surprise your father has in store.++++@++++Boy, oh boy!
Where's it from?++++@++++It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.
That'll take hours! On our anniversary!++++@++++And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: "for worse."
Yeah. I sell 'em on the internet for like-minded people. Now let's lay some track.++++@++++You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you.
What a wonderful anniversary.++++@++++You think we'll last twenty-five years?
So, you're the kind of man-eater Hall and Oates warned us all about.++++@++++Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!
Your wife and my husband have been watching British TV together.++++@++++Costume drama or naughty comedy?
Drama! Drama!++++@++++You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants.
That exists? Oh boy.++++@++++Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
Well, I was trying to buy you snack cakes...++++@++++Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear.
MARGE WAS FEELING LONELY AND BORED / EVERY NIGHT SHE WAS IGNORED++++@++++BUT WHEN MARGE WENT BOO HOO / I WAS BUILDING A CHOO-CHOO...
FIND LOVE ON THE NET++++@++++YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...
Yes it is, they're my lines as the scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz."++++@++++Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick.
Did you pack everything you need?++++@++++Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii.
Take that! In your face, boy! Ow, ow! / Hey! You stupid...++++@++++A whole weekend away from my family. I can't believe I have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. Send me a picture?
Yeah, they're the perfect combination of work, and binge drinking.++++@++++Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag.
Interested in learning a procedure that could save your life?++++@++++MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...
Um, all I have are these spec sheets.++++@++++MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF...
The wild man of Wichita!++++@++++I still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
He wasn't dead till you rolled over on him!++++@++++I'll kill you, you son of a--
Gibberish!++++@++++Hello, everyone.
Why didn't you call us?++++@++++All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
Well... I guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.++++@++++Yes, back to normal.
Yeah, it's tough being man of the house. You left some big underpants to fill. I didn't know they made Underoos in size fifty-two.++++@++++They're called "Superoos," son. With pictures of the cast of "The Expendables".
Why didn't you strangle me?++++@++++That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
Couldn't agree more! Now, to celebrate... ta-da! Pork chops crusted with Cheeto dust!++++@++++Uh, I'll pass on the pork.
Dad, what's that on your lap?!++++@++++A napkin.
Glad you're back, buddy. You've got a lot of catching up to do.++++@++++Can I just get a glass of water?
I've been having snuggle dreams!++++@++++Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed.
Oh my, what's that thing you're doing?++++@++++Moving my body.
Something happened to Dad on that trip. This is worse than when he went to New Orleans and came back with the southern accent.++++@++++How y'all doin'?
I haven't heard anything about you, except from you.++++@++++Hanging up the receiver, eh?
How much did you hear?++++@++++How much did you say?
Nothing really.++++@++++So I heard half of nothing.
Dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused.++++@++++Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.
When what's all over?!++++@++++This conversation.
What other side?++++@++++Of the house. Where the fireplace is. We're toasting marshmallows. Marshmallows.
Don't talk.++++@++++Okay.
I can torture you, I can give you incredible sex, or you can just tell me what I want to know.++++@++++What was the first one again?
I see, you're stupid.++++@++++Hey, I'm the one in bed with two beautiful women.
You think I'm beautiful?++++@++++In a breaking and entering kind of way.
Who are you talking to?++++@++++No one.
Whatcha got there, Homer?++++@++++Weird thing under a tarp.
Don't forget me!++++@++++You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
Please, don't do this, Dad! I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love.++++@++++I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?++++@++++Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa.
IF HE COMES A-CALLIN' YOU'D BETTER HIDE...++++@++++Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air.
I've told you that a million times!++++@++++Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in.
No one can use it but no one gets hurt!++++@++++Just like when I smell up the toilet.
There he is! Use your fattest handcuffs!++++@++++Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!
We did it, Dad. We did it.++++@++++We sure did.
You weren't shot!++++@++++No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--
You know, Dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking...++++@++++A beer from the sky! It's a sign!
I am the Borax! I speak for the woods! But I've plastered my likeness on consumer goods!++++@++++Shut up.
Aw geez. Strangle me out of this, Fatso.++++@++++Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!
I think we've made some progress here.++++@++++Great... oh, and I have this "two heads for one" coupon.
Well, that's for lettuce.++++@++++How 'bout this one?
Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls a wagon with his bare tongue!++++@++++THIS IS THE SONG THAT YOU HEAR AT THE CIRCUS / SUNG BY A GUY THAT YOU SEE AT THE CIRCUS...
Mr. Burnsum! You should treat these poor people with respect!++++@++++Marge! Get away from those freaks! You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute!
Well, you are the best this circus has to offer...++++@++++Taste the strength of your fiancÃ©!
With the mighty tongue God's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?++++@++++Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus.
My mother's ring. She gave it to me on her deathbed. She also acquired it on her deathbed. That was a very busy deathbed.++++@++++With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
You're gonna be sorry you said that.++++@++++You're gonna be sorry you said that.
I'm engaged to you, my love.++++@++++The poor lonely fellow is about to die.
Really? How?++++@++++Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake.
What ring?++++@++++The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.
Moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful.++++@++++Ho ho ho! A very small time!
One of us! Gooble goo! One of us! Gooble goo!++++@++++What the hell does gooble goo mean?
We don't know! Gooble goo! We don't know! Gooble goo!++++@++++You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say "Step right up"?
One of us! One of us!++++@++++This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.++++@++++People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
GET UP / EVERYBODY'S GONNA MOVE THEIR FEET++++@++++GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT
YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY!++++@++++Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever.
Well, for some reason it relaxes me. Now do that thing Gene Simmons does.++++@++++Overstay my welcome for forty years?
Now, let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones...++++@++++You cost me a piece of all of that!
If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold.++++@++++I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent!++++@++++You misheard that on purpose!
Anything from "Love Gun"!++++@++++Hey book, are you expecting this?
Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy.++++@++++I think I just might have what you're looking for.
Apple closed up another twenty points today.++++@++++Why does everyone know?!
Homer's rising faster than Apple stock!++++@++++My boy's okay!
You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one.++++@++++And together we are.
Feels like this play date's gone on forever.++++@++++I'll handle this. "Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid." And send.
I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me. I'm not supposed to have it. That's why I had so much.++++@++++What the?! If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
You Only Live Once.++++@++++Once again, cats have it better.
I'm sorry, but does Kirk know how silly he looks?++++@++++Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!
AND EVERY NIGHT / THE ENDING'S THE SAME++++@++++NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying Yolo.++++@++++Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past.
Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from?++++@++++My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
I am looking for my amigo de la pluma, or "pen pal."++++@++++Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?
To save the soul of Homer Simpson. Now where is he, old man?++++@++++I'm Homer Simpson!
Did your hair burn off in a fire that trapped you in a candy factory?++++@++++I wish.
Buenos dias, Eduardo. Can you write back and tell me what that means?++++@++++What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do.
And I, my friend, have been doing them!++++@++++Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children.
I've had eight wives... and two hundred children! Among them artists, doctors and revolutionary chefs.++++@++++Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
Hey, Homer. Did you just fart?++++@++++Did you just fart, sir.
Easy, easy, Homer, I want to help you fulfill some of your childhood dreams.++++@++++Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.
Now, this book of your childhood drawings will come to life.++++@++++Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?
In love with the concept of you, yes.++++@++++Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!
If you're happy I'm happy.++++@++++That doesn't sound happy.
I feel kind of... melancholy...++++@++++Mmm, melon collie.
That's not helping.++++@++++Well, what was your childhood dream?
Jumping on the bed. But I never disobeyed my parents, till I married you.++++@++++Let's do it.
I'm a little tired. Could we just snuggle again?++++@++++We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!
Here.++++@++++So that's it? All my dreams, lived?
Eh... all but one.++++@++++Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!
All right, Homer, we shall do this thing.++++@++++The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
Just step out that door and you can glide to earth like your boyhood hero: Rocky the Flying Squirrel.++++@++++Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence.
You don't have to flap. Just glide on the wind.++++@++++Okay.
You can listen to your wife when you are dead. Savor the moment.++++@++++Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness.
Good luck with that. The only thing that'll change my mind is a sign from God.++++@++++Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound.
My friend, you've lived your dreams.++++@++++No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it. And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me. But I have no regrets. In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before.
That's the morphine.++++@++++Can you give me the morphine forever?
No way! A person on morphine all the time would constantly dissolve in inappropriate laughter.++++@++++Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!
It was not just a dream and you said you'd drive me to the airport.++++@++++Oh yeah. Great. Um... Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in?
American football.++++@++++No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana.
Again? I was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.++++@++++It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.
You've got the touch tonight, Homer.++++@++++Nice sunglasses, Lenny.
What? What are you lookin' at?++++@++++I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money.
Two minutes apart.++++@++++Timing the elevators, eh? Smart.
No, no. I'm timing my contractions. I think I'm in labor. Deep in labor.++++@++++Okay, okay, no worries.
Do you have a cellphone?++++@++++Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.
The most beautiful moment of my life is happening NOW!++++@++++Everything will be fine... um... Oh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in "Alien."
Aw, that's sweet. Listen... I'm glad I'm not going through this alone. I haven't seen my boyfriend in months.++++@++++Oh, he was just here.
No he wasn't. But thanks for lying.++++@++++You like lies? Here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...
I think the baby's coming!++++@++++Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training...
Now, this next position is fantastic for women who are carrying especially big. Homer, can you demonstrate?++++@++++Yeah, wow, that does feel good. Oh no, I think it's coming. I haven't even picked a name yet!
You did this to me!++++@++++No, I didn't!
I'm talking to the baby. Here it comes!++++@++++Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--
Well, it was nice to share this moment with someone who cared.++++@++++Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once.
How was work?++++@++++Miraculous.
I had your jacket cleaned!++++@++++Good as new. And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. It may be a little stretched out.
So... you wanna hold little Homer?++++@++++Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m.
I thought we were playing cards.++++@++++Um, hey... I was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart...
Thanks. Hey... could you babysit for an hour? I've been alone with the baby for days.++++@++++Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight...
Full house?! You win again.++++@++++I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
Homie? Aw, you're shopping ahead for Maggie.++++@++++Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Junior, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!
Why are you saying that?++++@++++Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog...
First few weeks of what?++++@++++Um, November.
If he's not in there, where is he?++++@++++Oh baby!
So this is where you've been going -- another woman's apartment.++++@++++Marge, it's not what you think!
You have a baby together?++++@++++Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator.
I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.++++@++++But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good.
It's not good! None of it's good!++++@++++I haven't had a drink for a week.
...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.++++@++++It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.
Well I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. I thought that was strange poop on your collar.++++@++++Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth.
You know what? I think it's fine if Homer spends a few hours now and then with... Homer Junior.++++@++++Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
Late night at Moe's eh?++++@++++No. I'm exhausted from "Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes." It's the "toes" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes...
What about your own children?++++@++++Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.
Quit talking about that baby!++++@++++I was talking about myself in the third person.
Okay guys, I got your ice creams.++++@++++Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family.
Are you nuts? You can't even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble.++++@++++Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!
Dad! We're missing "The Giant Capybaras of Uruguay!"++++@++++Can I just say goodbye to him quick?
If they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!++++@++++Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!
This is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!++++@++++I'm sorry, Homer Junior. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill.
Homer, great news! Chase came back!++++@++++Woo hoo! Who's Chase?
Oh my God, is that my son?++++@++++You didn't tell me he was a soldier.
I didn't want you to marry me because I was pregnant. I wanted you to marry me because I was nagging you.++++@++++Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes.
Dude, he's my kid. He likes what I like.++++@++++But n-n-n-nurture...
He does, baby, he does!++++@++++I guess this is it, little guy.
Da-da.++++@++++The most beautiful words a father can hear.
Da-da! Da-da!++++@++++Oh.
Hey, one day you'll have kids of your own.++++@++++I do.
This is what we're fightin' for, babe.++++@++++Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Junior? What? There were cheerleaders in our house? And nobody told me?
So... you were going through a phase?++++@++++All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!
No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!++++@++++Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...++++@++++Why you little--
CGI also convenes CGI America, a meeting devoted to economic recovery and job creation...++++@++++You used to be fun.
First question: Ms. Simpson, what would you do to get America out of Afghanistan?++++@++++That's our girl.
Ice cream sandwiches. Why?++++@++++What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say. But...++++@++++What your mother is trying to say is--
Thanks, Mom. I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is.++++@++++Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's.
That's not where I buried them.++++@++++Come on.
Skinner didn't let me go.++++@++++Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.
I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do?++++@++++As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner.
You'll really help me get revenge?++++@++++Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?
I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.++++@++++Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?
Still, I can't be sure I killed her.++++@++++Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently.
Not compared to this.++++@++++Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.
Now do you want to dispose of this jelly-soaked pillow?++++@++++Just call me "The Cleaner."
She's in a better place.++++@++++The deed is done.
I wish you'd asked me before you...++++@++++Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?
No! No! God no!++++@++++Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.
If this were a movie mother wouldn't let me watch it.++++@++++Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors.
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes?++++@++++Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes.
Thanks for stickin' up for me.++++@++++Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.
Sure, Dad.++++@++++Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?
Seymour, when this fat guy and his kid asked me to fake my death to punish you, I said, "Sure, that's something to do."++++@++++You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful.
Homer, you have to take the Halloween decorations down before you put the Christmas ones up.++++@++++Marge, to that I say boo, humbug.
Meteorologists warn there'll be no snow this Christmas anywhere in America. Not even in Alaska, where the Eskimos now have a hundred words for "nothing."++++@++++Global Warming, huh? By pure coincidence, every scientist was right!
These are our new boarders!++++@++++Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.
This is a great thing! We're helping people celebrate Christmas, and we'll be able to afford Christmas!++++@++++Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January.
What would baby Jesus do?++++@++++Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!
I don't think you're giving them what they were promised, Dad.++++@++++The secret is don't read the comment cards.
Where do the people sit?++++@++++I thought they were just gonna watch me.
I've opened up my house to you. And all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.++++@++++Ho, ho, ho!
Not now. Take out that pillow and put it in room three.++++@++++The pillow acted as a girdle.
Now dad, I'd like to give you your present.++++@++++You got me weed?
Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow.++++@++++That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes.
Well, at least you're eating vegetables.++++@++++Vegetables?!
Children... perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.++++@++++Shut up, Flanders!
Oh...++++@++++Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?
Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot.++++@++++Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!
Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler.++++@++++But what if I want some cooled water?
Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past, when he was born in the future.++++@++++They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like.
Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to kill his own antimatter twin++++@++++AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
If Bart's going, I'm going!++++@++++If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!
We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.++++@++++Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!
Bye bye, Maggie!++++@++++Bye bye, money!
For the 3-D show, that'll be seventy-two dollars.++++@++++More snip, less lip.
Or, for ten dollars more you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision.++++@++++All right, movie, you better be worth it.
Also available in "Arctic Slut," "Morning After Melon," and "Elon Musk."++++@++++Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!
That's negative, man.++++@++++What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!
Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. You just have to illegally download it.++++@++++Illegally download it? Is that legal?
The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property. In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from Nascar's 2011 Martinsville Cup.++++@++++Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--
And play!++++@++++Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?
I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff.++++@++++Shut up shut up shut up!
Homer, go to the theater and see the movie.++++@++++Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
All we want is brand new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'! Why doesn't Hollywood get that?++++@++++Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!
No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!++++@++++And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fundraiser!++++@++++I live it, he writes it.
This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.++++@++++Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally.
An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.++++@++++Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the mastermind of this operation -- Homer Simpson!++++@++++Ooo, mastermind.
We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch.++++@++++One of you turned me in? Who was it?
From now on, the only place you'll be watching movies without having to buy a ticket is jail.++++@++++Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!
Drug trafficking. What about you?++++@++++Movie piracy.
Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.++++@++++I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!
Bah! Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves -- claiming all their hit movies have lost money. I spit on their bookkeeping!++++@++++Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to "Taken" where the "Hangover" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is "Fast and Furious."
I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.++++@++++Consulate.
It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.++++@++++You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?++++@++++Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?
I never wanted to say funny vows!++++@++++Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing.++++@++++All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.
Homer Simpson, you have been found guilty of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material. Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself?++++@++++No.
Homer, tell them your side of the story. I know I hurt you, but please trust me now. It'll work.++++@++++You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.
But where's the love story?++++@++++At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
He's hitting all four quadrants!++++@++++One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost.
And the worst one of all is--++++@++++I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
It's still got time code on it, but otherwise, it's a clean copy.++++@++++You're pirating my movie?
But the movie is, it's about you pirating movies.++++@++++Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called "prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion".
Homie, do you really think you should be--++++@++++Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
Would you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight?++++@++++And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy.
You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life!++++@++++Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!
Wrong! Wrong! Wr-- or... is he?++++@++++C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife.
Oh right, you have a loving wife?++++@++++Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
Actually, it is you that I am here to see. I, um, I need your help... in getting ready for a date. The closest thing I have to a father is the Obi-Wan doll in my store. And he comes from a race of celibate knights, so...++++@++++I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle?++++@++++Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!
In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide!++++@++++Honki da yo?!
But the walls are covered with garbage.++++@++++Not garbage, Americana.
Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?++++@++++We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone.
And getting the termites out of the trees.++++@++++Not a word.
Excuse me, sir, I am looking for my daughter. I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of non-pornographic manga.++++@++++You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!
I am not Kung Fu instructor. I am humble salaryman who could kick your ass. Say, has anyone told you you look like--++++@++++I know, Mr. Sparkle.
I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke.++++@++++I get that a lot too.
Now please, where is my daughter?++++@++++Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old.
So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement?!++++@++++I didn't tell you about the basement.
Homer, we have much in common. We both love our daughters and discipline our sons.++++@++++No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?
Snake rice wine.++++@++++Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?
The good thing is, soon I'll be a beautiful swan.++++@++++What's going on here?
Dad, Bart's feet are on my half of the shell!++++@++++Why you slimy little...!?
How long am I gonna stay this way?++++@++++As long as we keep drinking this.
Rumor has it they're about to give out the company Christmas gifts.++++@++++Who told you that?
Look at you, Mr. Connected.++++@++++I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
Finally I'm not a slave to my stupid human eyeballs!++++@++++Glasses! Call Lenny!
I'm getting a call! Answer call! Hello?++++@++++Lenny! It's me, Homer!
Huh. I always thought it was Simpsen.++++@++++Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
What's so funny?++++@++++I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses.++++@++++I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are "Funny Or Die". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died...
Interesting. When was the term "shut up" invented?++++@++++As early as eighteen fifty-nine, "shut up" was used to shut up...
Homie, I think the kids are just hungry.++++@++++Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford.
Accessing soup kitchens...++++@++++That's it, I'm taking you off.
I'm sorry, sir.++++@++++Okay, let's see what we've got here.
Are you using your glasses for snuggling?!++++@++++Where's my money?
I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.++++@++++Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars.
Here's your breakfast.++++@++++Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!
Well, I'm not happy with you.++++@++++Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?
Yes. Just like I told you.++++@++++Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them.
That's strange. I'm hearing a voice, but I'm not seeing a user icon.++++@++++Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!
Hey, Homer! A lot of information about you. Let me just page through it.++++@++++Ow!
Such a good baby! You deserve some ice cream.++++@++++Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.
Maggie, he's here!++++@++++Is she having an affair?
Thanks for asking me to lunch.++++@++++Why isn't she having an affair?
Who are you?!++++@++++Mr. Burns!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. I won't disturb you again.++++@++++Marge, that's a compact-only space!
Okay, I guess.++++@++++Marge is in therapy?
Well, he's down to two beers in the shower...++++@++++Pale ales. Please.
Everything in the newspaper makes him mad.++++@++++Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
Whoa. She has crossed a line. How did you find out?++++@++++Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids...
What? That's crazy! Come on, you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower!++++@++++I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.
Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you "bump into" Midge in the waitin' room, there.++++@++++Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?
Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!++++@++++Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?
Please fill out these forms, Mr. Fakinami.++++@++++That's "Fake Name."
I'll just call you Elias.++++@++++That's "Alias." Du-uh.
Dr. Carlock is like my Wednesday reset button.++++@++++Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
Come on in, Mr. Fakinami.++++@++++No need. Everything's fine.
I'm sorry. But there are no cancellations within twenty-four hours.++++@++++Well, as long as I'm paying for the time...
Oh I forgot to tell you, Homie! I bumped into Helen Lovejoy today, and guess what?++++@++++I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets.
It's not a secret. It's a funny story.++++@++++Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so.
Oh, I bet my story's more interesting.++++@++++Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.
Okay, so Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!++++@++++Yeah. And?
That's it. That was the story.++++@++++Where's that cake now?
It got sold.++++@++++Who bought it?
Dr. Hibbert.++++@++++Excuse me. I have to make a call.
Don't take too long!++++@++++Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged.
Dad? Please? For Sumadi?++++@++++Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well.
Please!++++@++++All right, son... but you have to pay me back.
Life is good.++++@++++Do you have my money?
How could I?++++@++++Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?
Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation. Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?++++@++++Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?
Homer, quit badgering the boy.++++@++++Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge.
I don't have any diamonds.++++@++++Quit pressuring me!
Here's your money, dad.++++@++++What? Did you owe me some money?
Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's "muy tarde." Is it all right to say "tarde?"++++@++++Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep.
I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.++++@++++Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.
Bart Simpson, at your service.++++@++++More like "at your six-pack," am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap.
Why would I want a nap?++++@++++Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
That doesn't sound like you.++++@++++But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time.++++@++++It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.++++@++++Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.++++@++++At least someone in this family is using them.
Diggs isn't cuckoo!++++@++++Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler.
Then why is Diggs there?++++@++++Because it's his home forever.
Lisa, I'd like to thank you for mollifying these land apes. We'd like you and your family to visit us at the Monsarno research campus.++++@++++Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?
Doctor Sideshow Bob.++++@++++Real doctor or PhD?
Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob!++++@++++Sideshow Bob!
Wait! Wait! Won't you visit me again? Let me show you I really am trying to make a better world. Lisa, we can talk Walt Whitman... And Homer, I think you'd enjoy the company of the campus's lazy overfed squirrels.++++@++++Overfed? I don't know this word.
This is the pinnacle of conversation around here.++++@++++Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.
That was a sexual harassment seminar!++++@++++It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
You already ate all the chocolate bars.++++@++++That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any.++++@++++Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President.
Are you saying I'm wasting my time?++++@++++No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given.
Shut your eyes, they're too bright.++++@++++Sorry.
That means, three days ago... the two of you... made the blob with two backs!++++@++++Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place.
He's touching her!++++@++++What the--
I'll sign the pledge! Just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head!++++@++++Never!
NON PIÃ™ ANDRAI, FARFALLONE AMOROSO...++++@++++How dare you torture my children with Mozart!
Ahh, you know Mozart?++++@++++I call all music Mozart!
Oh, urgent notice.++++@++++If it's not final, who cares?
This place is unlivable.++++@++++My contract clearly promised "barely livable"!
Like I said, a lotta violations.++++@++++Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog "partner."
No kennels!++++@++++You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad.
Don't get fat!++++@++++Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?
Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday.++++@++++Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.
Homer, how are we doing with those cots?++++@++++Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me.
Well... I really think you should watch your temper.++++@++++I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!
Stupid kid. Do you really think that's the way we should communicate?++++@++++You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--
Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa?++++@++++Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.
Your Grampa's alive?++++@++++Oh yeah!
Please.++++@++++Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself.
Oh... I'll see what I can do.++++@++++I can handle them from now on, Marge.
What's your point, pound cake?++++@++++I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
Yeah, we're mall walking.++++@++++Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
Now say something pathetic.++++@++++Uh, okay! Um... I can't.
Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one?++++@++++All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge.
Don't call me a gal. Makes me feel like I'm your mother.++++@++++Better turn up the heat.
Are you wearing sock garters?++++@++++Young lady, in my day...
Your day is my day! We're the same age! You're turning into your father!++++@++++You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer?++++@++++Falsies.
I'd love to, but I'm sure that it's some sort of a holiday for me.++++@++++Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.
Ow! Ow! No! I've never really been in a fight!++++@++++Now let's go home, son.
Ooh, what's your hurry?++++@++++We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
And when they get excited they jump straight up -- it's called popcorning!++++@++++Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you.
"I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other.++++@++++Circle "other."
Oh, my God -- I'm getting a guinea pig! Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!++++@++++The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave.
You're doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig. You know, most of these guys are rejects from the big guinea-pig mills in the Midwest. Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.++++@++++You don't have children, do you?
Lisa! You've just gotta choose one. Lisa!?++++@++++She's gone, honey. She's gone.
Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy.++++@++++She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!
No, that's a much bigger animal.++++@++++Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting.++++@++++Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.++++@++++Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.
This could be our new living room painting!++++@++++I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
Oh, it looks great!++++@++++Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.
We should have it appraised!++++@++++You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
I expect it to go somewhere between eighty to one hundred thousand dollars.++++@++++Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!
But I want to see it!++++@++++No, you'll wear it out!
Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.++++@++++Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.++++@++++Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.
For ourselves?++++@++++This dude gets it.
But the Van Houtens are our friends!++++@++++I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
Well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?++++@++++I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.
How about this... what if we give the Van Houtens twenty-five percent of the money?++++@++++Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens.++++@++++What'll it take to buy your silence?
You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?!++++@++++We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...
Kind!? You call it kind to give us nothing?++++@++++We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!
Oh, so that's how it is!++++@++++That's exactly how it is.
Oh is it?++++@++++Oh it is.
See what happens when we get greedy?++++@++++Honey, there's something I wanna show you.
An ATM receipt?++++@++++I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance.
Five figures!++++@++++With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.
I could write a check with... today's date on it.++++@++++That's the cushion.
Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!++++@++++Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
Give back the painting! The whole town's turned against us!++++@++++"You have no obligation to share the money from that painting." Ooo, a support rock!
You really think we're still doing the right thing?++++@++++Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
First lot: "Untitled Landscape" by Johan Oldenveldt, from the Collection of Homer J. and Marge B. Simpson. Let's open the bidding at eighty thousand dollars.++++@++++The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!
The auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership.++++@++++Our cushion!
See what your greed has done?++++@++++Excuse me, we're trying to find "CafÃ© Artiste."
Thanks for taking me in, man...++++@++++I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.
Oh Luann... I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.++++@++++What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?
Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called Isla Verde. I bought the painting in a cafÃ©... but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.++++@++++Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.
He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.++++@++++But our cushion...
You're not gonna let it go, are you?++++@++++I wish I knew how.
This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance!++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.
That's a terrible thing for a father to do.++++@++++That's why she'll believe it.
Welcome to CafÃ© Artiste! Would you like a glass of Strupo? It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.++++@++++Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.
Oh, yes, I remember that painting. And that is the man I sold it to.++++@++++And that man sold it to me!
I painted it! Me, Klaus Ziegler!++++@++++Who?
This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.++++@++++Prove it.
What!?++++@++++Now let's play human foosball!
But, you still, I mean... I suppose you're right.++++@++++What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?
Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance. If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart.++++@++++While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
Oh, perfect. Now that's art.++++@++++Rockin'
Okay, Dad's my hero. Why is he my hero?++++@++++Marge, it happened again!
My hero isn't famous...++++@++++Loser.
...isn't rich...++++@++++Pathetic.
...and isn't in any history books...++++@++++He makes me sick.
That's what heroes do.++++@++++I'm so glad I was forced to come.
Oh, dad, you don't want details. No one wants to see the sausage being made.++++@++++There's sausage being made? Where?
Homie, there's someone here to see you.++++@++++Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.
Mr. Simpson, I am the executive vice president of the World Football Federation.++++@++++Ooh!
I'm sure you are familiar with the World Cup. the quadrennial drama unmatched on the planet!++++@++++Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
I mean it spread like wildfire.++++@++++Much better.
Mr. Simpson, I am the new executive vice president of the WFF. We need outsiders like you to come to the World Cup, as our guests, and ref our games properly.++++@++++Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession.
Dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!++++@++++The two thousand eight Super Bowl?
Oh, I wish! Eli Manning's pass to David Tyree... But about the World Cup. I need your answer now.++++@++++Sure, why not?
Look, you got us a free trip. Just slack off and cash your check like you always do.++++@++++I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.
Eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on...++++@++++Here you go, honey.
How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?++++@++++The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.
Homer Simpson! I would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today.++++@++++Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
We have two ways. Two very good ways.++++@++++Red card!
Let me give that back to you.++++@++++Get outta here!
While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich.++++@++++How fresh?
Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?++++@++++Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?++++@++++I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.++++@++++Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.
Where are you going?++++@++++To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
So the rumors are true. We knew you'd find out your daughter's original speech topic was Marie Curie. And now we need you to fix the greatest game of all: the World Cup Final.++++@++++Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.
All right. But we've run out of sugarcane.++++@++++I carry my own.
You know that Brazil is going to win!++++@++++Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.
Remember, I'll be watching.++++@++++Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
Don't do it, Dad. Don't cheat.++++@++++You're a funny one to tell me about deception.
I'm sorry you weren't my first choice. In fact... I had my doubts about using you at all.++++@++++Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness.
You put it on the fridge!++++@++++It was pity-fridged!
All right, you're hurt. I understand. But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad.++++@++++Oh, come here.
No penalty! He dove, Dad!++++@++++No penalty!
You broke a deal with us. And we have lost a fortune.++++@++++Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants.
Wow, the Amazon is just like I pictured it after seeing all those pictures online.++++@++++I've never seen anything so beautiful.
Homie, what happened?++++@++++Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
The only way out is in!++++@++++Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
Senator!++++@++++Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?
I'll come back with the fire truck. I just have to get the kids to school first.++++@++++Oh, are the kids with you?
Hi, Dad! / Homer.++++@++++Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?
At least we hope it's bottom.++++@++++Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
It's pronounced "Luca-dollar". That's my competition name. I'm a competitive eater.++++@++++Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?
No! You didn't hear anything!++++@++++Yes I did! I heard "competitive eater"!
It's for people who haven't had heart problems!++++@++++Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!
Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman!++++@++++I will when you open your mind to change!
Really? "Justin Blobber" over there doesn't remind you of anyone?++++@++++Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.
Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! "What every father should do for his daughter."++++@++++Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine.
Right, right, right, right. According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!++++@++++Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?
It's not a punishment. But you can't just eat dinner. You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.++++@++++Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion.
Not fake attentive. Real attentive.++++@++++Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash.
No! Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry. If you just act like yourself, she might just... Oh, you know?++++@++++She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?
Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble.++++@++++Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!
Well, I was just trying to--++++@++++I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.
Now you quit stallin' and call your daughter like a man!++++@++++Feels weird.
Omigod, omigod, omigod!++++@++++Oh, It's ringing!
Dad? Did you just call?++++@++++Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime...
Just the two of us?++++@++++Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--
I'd love that. See you tonight!++++@++++Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!
Hair volumizer... Cologne?++++@++++Hello, Marjorie.
Homie! You look like an N.B.A. coach!++++@++++Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey.
All right, you've made your point.++++@++++Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me.
Homie, I don't have a problem with you. Except your buttons are off one.... Actually, this is a collar button... see? It goes like this...++++@++++Is there no end to your fault-finding?!
So, Mr. Burns never realized it was Maggie who saved the plant?++++@++++Nope. Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley?
Well, have we decided?++++@++++Uh, yeah, help me out here. What is the "normal amount" of entrees per person?
Eh, one, sir.++++@++++I mean for adults!
One.++++@++++No. I mean for adult males.
Yes. I repeat, one.++++@++++All right, I'll have the lasagna.
All right. Meat or vegetarian?++++@++++Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?
Homer, could you come with me for a minute?++++@++++Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!
We need to have a conversation in loud whispers.++++@++++Um. Excuse me, Lisa.
Homie, I felt terrible when you said I felt "stuck" with you. But then, I realized: I am stuck with you. I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.++++@++++I'm sorry, that's all very nice. But I can't forget what you said.
I know, Homie. I know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. But I also know you well enough to know that this will work.++++@++++Where'd you get that dress?
Remember that sewing machine you say I never use? Well, I sold it and bought this dress!++++@++++Wow. Wow. That looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.
Sh-sh-sh!++++@++++Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner.
And your lasagna with cow blood, sir.++++@++++Thanks, Frenchy.
Please let it be a bear that did this.++++@++++Oh, how much did I eat?!
Homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself.++++@++++Pfft! I'm as healthy as a horse.
If you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. That's all I ask...++++@++++Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now.
Stop! Stop with the wailing and the gnashing, and the . Homer is not dead! I have made a copy!++++@++++I'm number two!
Oh Dad, you're back! Just in time for my recital!++++@++++Somebody kill me.
Now Homie, I hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life.++++@++++Amen, baby! Did you make potato salad for the wake?
Oh heya Midge, uh, here we are again, huh? And, uh, here. My new card.++++@++++I'm back! Comin' through!
Homer, you'll be all right. But no solid food for two weeks.++++@++++Two weeks?
We are gathered here to mourn the passing of yet another Homer Simpson. Beloved father... precious memories... local character... etcetera. Okay, we're ready for the crematorium bot.++++@++++Wait a minute!
All is not lost! I was able to download Homer's brain into this flash drive. It'll have to do.++++@++++Yo. Where's my body?
Oh, you used up all your clones, you fat, fat, fat reckless, fat pig! From now on you're just going to be a face on a monitor. So, enjoy screensaver mode.++++@++++Bonk! Bonk! Bonk! Ooh, corner! Ba-donk!
After thirty-five years of wifely obedience, I'm married to a face on a screen.++++@++++It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge.
Things aren't great with Lisa. If it wasn't for that squirrel that eats our bird food, we'd have nothing to talk about.++++@++++Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot.
Nothing for thirty years. You're perfect for each other.++++@++++No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--
Wow. Wow. You've really grown. We should have dinner sometime.++++@++++Sure.
Wow. Everyone's back together except Gramma and Grampa.++++@++++I think that's about to change.
After thirty-five years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right.++++@++++Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade.
On the next week of Fox Television's, "The Simpsons:"++++@++++Sit down.
See ya, Homer! / Bye, Dad!++++@++++Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!
I didn't mean to make her pregnant. I just hate art so much.++++@++++Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit.
So, uh, your boy's got magic knock-up powers, huh?++++@++++Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that.
Not true! Whenever I compliment your virility, you act all weird. And you are very virile.++++@++++Yeah... well just talk about sports!
Homie, I can't find my spatula! Can you get another one?++++@++++Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!
That was my spatula!++++@++++And you never bought a replacement?
Maybe when I've got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar?++++@++++Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.
Aren't those full of germs?++++@++++Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!
Nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers.++++@++++Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home.
That's right, Fat Homer.++++@++++Hey!
I need your boy to make a baby.++++@++++Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop.
Y'know. Just sayin'.++++@++++Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it.
One more thing -- it better be a boy.++++@++++Anything else?
Hey, this is all your fault.++++@++++How is it my fault?
I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf...++++@++++I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!++++@++++Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.
What's his problem?++++@++++Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls.
Big deal. I don't like girls either.++++@++++Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.
Ew. That tastes horrible!++++@++++Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
Whoa! They like each other!++++@++++You know, pregnant is pregnant...
WE'LL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD++++@++++BE THAT AS IT MAY
I DO NOT HEAR NO BANGING / NO SOUND OF HORSESHOES CLANGING...++++@++++ROLL IN HAY!
OR TOMORROW WE WILL PAY!++++@++++I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY
ROLL IN HAY!++++@++++Ah, young love.
Ay carumba++++@++++You monster! My knees will be in my throat!
Cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot.++++@++++Teach him not to pee during parades. He'll get more work.
Yay! A mess!++++@++++Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling?
Homer! For the last time, do not drink the Yahtzee dice!++++@++++Fine.
Why don't we have any couples friends?++++@++++Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four.
I want friends. Any friends.++++@++++Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens.
Not the Van Houtens.++++@++++But...
The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was "I got your message." G'night.++++@++++They all make good points.
Come and get 'em!++++@++++Oh. Thank you. Why was that on the Military History Channel?
And stay in the living room. Don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.++++@++++Can I check out what toys they have?
One drink.++++@++++Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!
Yes. Yes! So for the next three hours, I welcome you to the moors of--++++@++++They'll get their blood money.
You've... you... you've given away the game.++++@++++Well, you know--
Just so you know, Homer, you were going to be a dashing Russian Count with multiple lovers!++++@++++Well, as we say in Russia: "Goodbye in Russian"!
I'd like to be alone for a while.++++@++++Do you want to be more alone?
Mm, hm.++++@++++What the?
It's okay. I mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. I think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized.++++@++++Mmmm--
Don't you dare say "ostrich eyes."++++@++++Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?
Nothing. I give up. No more dinner parties. Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.++++@++++I see.
Yes, for us. But not for Lisa! Never for Lisa. We're going to help her make friends.++++@++++It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.
After this we'll do makeovers!++++@++++So... where are all the friends?
I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.++++@++++Who are you?
Gus Huebner. I was on Lisa's coed soccer team two years ago.++++@++++Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm fine.++++@++++Yeah. Nothin-- Nothing's going on.
Pizza. Mmmm.++++@++++Lots of pizza.
It's not optional.++++@++++See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone.
I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend. I just gave her money for records and ice cream.++++@++++You gave away ice cream?!
Lisa. Lisa, wait...++++@++++Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent.
Let me tell you a little story about a chubby, unpopular boy named Homer.++++@++++Is that the boy you named me after?
A relationship I continued to this day.++++@++++You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?
Lisa's door's unlocked!++++@++++Dad, is that story really true?
Mother's Day?!++++@++++Crap!
Last day of scho-ol! Last day of scho-ol! Found my summer hob-by! Banging pots togeth-er!++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp.
Goodbye forever, multiplication!++++@++++Needs more numerators.
My baby... back ribs!++++@++++Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her.
Maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard.++++@++++I've had my problems with sparklers.
No, no, but I shoot rockets into his-a face. Here's-a my card. Don't forget to treasure it.++++@++++Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are.
Why do you come here and remind me of a time in my life when I made a-tons of money doing a-what I love?++++@++++If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten.
Have you ever considered a reverse-equity mortgage?++++@++++Woo hoo!
Now drive slowly and carefully to my workshop. It's in-a the Cobblestone a-District.++++@++++Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.
Actually, July second is when congress declared independence -- the date that should be celebrated.++++@++++Hey, Super Mario. Don't you tell me about America!
Idiot! I'm-a right!++++@++++No, you're a-wrong!
July second! I am quoting John Adams!++++@++++Who the hell is that?!
I WANNA HOLD YOU TILL I DIE++++@++++One more year, tops.
I live-a longer than you! I taking a "senior spin" class. Always increasing the tension!++++@++++Then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!
I WANNA HOLD YOU TILL THE FEAR IN ME SUBSIDES++++@++++Believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem.
Congratulations, you have ruined a beautiful song.++++@++++It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.
I apologize to Dan Hill and all of our viewers.++++@++++I don't!
Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!++++@++++Out of my reach? Must... make... effort...
Mr. Simpson, you earned this.++++@++++What's on TV?
Well no... but he's not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi.++++@++++Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!
All right, you're not a Flabbi! Okay! I got it!++++@++++All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!
No, no, it's a big thing.++++@++++Yes, son. We can.
Homer, get up!++++@++++Huh? Oh.
Wrapping you in bubble wrap. I can't always be around to protect you, so it will.++++@++++But...
I guess you're right.++++@++++Now come on, give Daddy a hug.
I suppose we should exchange insurance information. I don't have any.++++@++++Me neither.
The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.++++@++++I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.
Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.++++@++++I'm in charge. You do what I say.
I'll get to it when I get to it.++++@++++That better not mean what it means when I say it.
Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.++++@++++We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!
Look, I'll drink another glass of milk.++++@++++Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.
Oh it!++++@++++You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.
The sit is on.++++@++++Eat your broccoli.
I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside.++++@++++Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal.++++@++++Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team.
Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end.++++@++++Uh, works for me.
Oh no, the broccoli!++++@++++You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
Where are we?++++@++++I don't know. Eat your broccoli.
Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat.++++@++++I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches.++++@++++Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?
So what if I am?++++@++++You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!
I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor.++++@++++Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.
I learned that left is called "port"!++++@++++I finally got over my sea sickness.
I'm sorry we had to discipline you. On the positive side, you won't miss out on the father/son hornpipe dance.++++@++++I hate the Golden Age of Sail.
I'm in charge. You do what I say.++++@++++Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.
You know what, Homer? I always wanted to eat a parrot. What's the big deal? It's just like a green chicken.++++@++++Yeah...
Dad! We can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse!++++@++++Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
No, we need to sail!++++@++++I'm dropping the anchor!
Can't you just do what I say?!++++@++++You've never done what I say! Ever!
Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet!++++@++++Aye-aye, sir.
So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?++++@++++Does this answer your question?
WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE++++@++++I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL
Really, really, really?++++@++++My one weakness: the third "really." Come with me.
But that's so many sandwiches!++++@++++Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
Homer! This is my freezerino.++++@++++Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms.
It's the name of the freezer!++++@++++Okily Dokahama?!
I'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches.++++@++++And I will wait and worry!
...so, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog...++++@++++Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!
Dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating.++++@++++Lucky.
Can someone put butter on me?++++@++++Familyicious.
Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me.++++@++++Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!
Never claimed to be.++++@++++Yeah! And aren't!
Homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?++++@++++None.
All you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.++++@++++Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.
I'm sorry I woke you up. I'm just so anxious about tomorrow. What if the store fails? What if I fail?++++@++++Well, you woke up the right man in bed.
Hello! No change for the meter.++++@++++No, no, I'd like to see the manager.
Mrs. Boss! Some fat blob wants to see you.++++@++++Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!
You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted then I changed my mind and I hate it so much I'm faking stomach aches to get out of it.++++@++++Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that.
I need a six-foot party sub. Lots of mayonnaise. And I mean lots. Never stop squirting mayo.++++@++++Don't worry, baby.
How could they open another franchise so close to me?++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run.
Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven.++++@++++Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee.
Sorry you died! Put the body with the others.++++@++++Whew!
Oh. Now I completely understand you.++++@++++I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.
I got this.++++@++++Why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!
If you'll just give me back my original investment, I'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries.++++@++++Please tell me I'm still beautiful!
Right here?++++@++++What?
Homie! Our prayers have been answered!++++@++++Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through "book fairs" and "silent auctions." And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits "reply all" to everything!
Dad, it's not a private school. It's free.++++@++++Oh, that's fine then.
I couldn't help noticing this school is located in... I'm not one to judge, but... um...++++@++++I'll say it, Marge, it's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf!
We do have golf, but all the greens are tricky.++++@++++Nooo!
Look, as educators, our job is to gently nurture your child's passion.++++@++++Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
You know, we have many opportunities for parent involvement...++++@++++Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that.
Homer? That-that's my dad. I can't hurt him.++++@++++No, boy. I want you to do it.
Well, I'll tell you who is supposed to be here -- class mal-edictorian, Beelzebart Simpson!++++@++++Which one's yours?
Take a picture, it'll last longer, man.++++@++++Hey... if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license.
Well, I traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich.++++@++++He is me!
Homer, do something!++++@++++Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!
What kind of afterlife is this? Can't even strangle my dead kid.++++@++++So... yeah. Things aren't perfect with the missus and me. And by the way, nice melons.
I'm just happy you're happy.++++@++++I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
I feel like a ghost the way you haven't been paying attention to me. Plus, I'm dead.++++@++++Don't yell at me! I'm a double widower! But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!
Won't the other Homer be a problem?++++@++++I think he gets it. See, he--
I also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.++++@++++Woo hoo!
They kept yelling "La Joconde -- her smile will die!"++++@++++No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!
You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.++++@++++Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy.
You know what? I trust them not to smoke.++++@++++And if you trust them, I trust them too.
Nature is God's ash tray.++++@++++Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain.
Choke on our harmless fumes.++++@++++If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?
Wait, wait. Turn on the faucet so no one'll get suspicious.++++@++++Ha! I gotcha!
Please, show some compassion for two good people who just can't stop smoking.++++@++++I know just the place.
Congratulations Simpson. You're now my Chief Energy Innovation Marketing Officer.++++@++++Woo-hoo!
All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.++++@++++Woo-hoo? I don't know... "Fracking" is one of those scary Lisa words.
Homer, game starts in an hour. Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup.++++@++++Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad.
How could you sell fracking for Mr. Burns?++++@++++Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want.
I am judging you.++++@++++Good, judge away.
Mr. Simpson? Rebuttal?++++@++++Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!
I have embarked on a "beneficial friendship" with a woman with whom I have nothing in common. Her opinions are abhorrent to me. But the passion... well, look at these racy texts she sends me.++++@++++Oh baby...
Hmm... Well then I must harden my heart against such an outcome.++++@++++Glad I could be of help...
The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson!++++@++++Marge? Why didn't you sign?
I already felt the pride of energy independence!++++@++++Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
Our water was on fire.++++@++++Was on fire. Was. I finally get a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up.
So, you've come begging not to be fired? Smithers, turn my back on this man. Maximum huff!++++@++++Wait, Mr. Burns! I'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common.
Nothing in common, eh? Tell me more...++++@++++Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways.
Different, exactly. That's why I had to give my woman the old heave-ho.++++@++++So you don't miss that politics lady at all?
Stop laying about, you! There's work to be done.++++@++++Gravy Thursday.
Homer! Turn off that horrible machine!++++@++++You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use "fracking" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!
Our. Water. Was. On. Fire!++++@++++Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
Wiggle in. Get comfortable.++++@++++Hey, a couch is a couch.
Homer! Homer. I think there's someone downstairs.++++@++++Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's.
Uh, that's a mirror.++++@++++Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
Bite my shiny metal ass!++++@++++A robot with a catchphrase!
...the future!++++@++++Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?
I don't know. You die?++++@++++Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.
I hate it when they get quiet.++++@++++Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion...
It's true! I'm empty inside.++++@++++Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?
A strike! A totally legitimate strike!++++@++++Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?
Romance.++++@++++You future guys have a word for everything... pal.
I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson!++++@++++My ears are burning.
Not yet, but they will be.++++@++++A boxing glove!
What the?! My ass is about to project something.++++@++++You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control?++++@++++What the?
Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful. Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period. Find out why people would ever pay for "freemium games."++++@++++I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?
Get a load of those freaks.++++@++++...and you're like "ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."
Kill all humans... kill all humans...++++@++++Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...
And the other person is...++++@++++Who is that?!
Dad, it-it's me!++++@++++Prove it. When's your birthday?
February twenty-third.++++@++++Ha! February has no twenty-third!
Oh, are you good at your job?++++@++++I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little...
Dad, we have beer in our time!++++@++++Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years.
Wow, it's working! I guess the instructions were in English.++++@++++What the?
Hey, here's a souvenir photo of you guys comin' outta my chest.++++@++++Aww, I will treasure this forever.
The old-fashioned way.++++@++++Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us.
Well, perhaps the one of you that is female should go console her.++++@++++SIMPSONS, IN THE / FUTURE -- SPACE JOKES! / FLYING THROUGH TOWN / WHAT ARE THOSE TUBES / I WONDER WHAT / ICE CREAM'S LIKE NOW / MAYBE IT'S HOT / OR SOME NEW TEMPERATURE THEY INVENTED... That's it, we're done.
Terrible.++++@++++You wanna talk about it?
No, you'll laugh at me.++++@++++I won't laugh at you. Let's see--
I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.++++@++++Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs.
Well, anyway Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend.++++@++++What camping trip?
The one you booked for us at Owl Haven. The one you have to reserve a year in advance.++++@++++Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?
I don't remember that!++++@++++You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?
Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! Labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!++++@++++Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost.
Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot.++++@++++Excuse me, but grass is poking through.
Parking lot.++++@++++Poking through.
My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.++++@++++Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby.
I want so much to believe you.++++@++++And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?
Oh, that's convenient.++++@++++Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.
Sorry, reservations are a year in advance.++++@++++What about Mosquito Cove?
Booked.++++@++++Skunk Canyon?
Booked every year since two thousand three.++++@++++Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
Sir, that is a movie.++++@++++Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!
Those were your father's sweatpants.++++@++++Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip.
BUT WHERE? I STILL DON'T KNOW!++++@++++A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...
A world of anarchic free expression!++++@++++Cars shaped like cupcakes!
I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.++++@++++All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?
Now you know the wind does kick up here. Hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes.++++@++++Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent.
Does that look like something I'd do?++++@++++Hey Marge!
Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.++++@++++This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
It's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.++++@++++Get... in... the tent!
Homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and I got one.++++@++++Just like I planned.
You got very lucky this time. Don't push it.++++@++++I understand. I already signed up for this place next year. I Gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
Help me, desert weirdoes!++++@++++I'll take those.
Look at all these monstrosities.++++@++++Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?
(IMPRESSED NOISE++++@++++It's like some kind of guitar central.
Okay, let me guess, dude, you're an axe-man -- you're looking to score a new blade.++++@++++Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.
Try this on.++++@++++What the rock?
Now that was a lick.++++@++++I did a lick?
Dude, usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence. Now check this out:++++@++++Oh my god... I'm amazing.
Okay. Now oh, how are you set for stage lights?++++@++++I'm not set at all.
OOh, what about gels?++++@++++This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels.
WHAT IS THAT RACKET?++++@++++MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!
WHAT?++++@++++Beautiful music, baby.
The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like... you.++++@++++Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.
It's so cool to have another musician in the family!++++@++++Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy.
Uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--++++@++++So easy.
Garage bands rule!++++@++++I almost forgot the most important thing.
Excuse me... My wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band. And uh, perhaps you need a singer?++++@++++Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a "world music" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music.
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES / I WISH THAT I COULD FANTASIZE / PULL A DREAM RIGHT OUT OF THE AIR / TAKE A CHANCE TURN IT INTO A PRAYER...++++@++++That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music.
FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM / I'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL I WANT SOMETHING GREAT / HOPIN' FOR A DREAM...++++@++++Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?
I think we all felt something.++++@++++We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.
And it sounds like Hovercraft.++++@++++That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in.
You don't know what a per diem is.++++@++++I still want one.
Everyone loves you, Dad. You could become a famous rock star!++++@++++Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds.
Yeah, you really get that it's all about the music.++++@++++Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...
Uh, he passed away.++++@++++How?
Apu, you're the only man on the entire internet whose got the pure Sungazer sound. Will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour?++++@++++I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted.
Uh, actually... I...++++@++++Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--
I gotta say, I'm kind of jealous of Apu getting a break like that.++++@++++Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
What's a game show?++++@++++It's something you make sketches about.
HOPIN'...++++@++++I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.
Wow, he's right.++++@++++You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.
You mean more popular but not as good?++++@++++Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? "No Reply at All," "Land of Confusion," "Throwing it All Away," "Illegal Alien," "I Can't Dance," and I'm sure I don't need to mention... "Invisible Touch!"
You know, I've been known to sing a little...++++@++++What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!
You can't just kick him out--++++@++++Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands.
How can there be two Yokos--++++@++++Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!
You sound great! Your licks are really... juicy.++++@++++They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
You didn't join a band to become famous like in "Almost Famous." You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy.++++@++++Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics.
Apu is a good man. He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.++++@++++Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?
Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent.++++@++++I'll never have a per diem.
Homer!?++++@++++I'm sorry, Apu. I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it. But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it.
What is the point? I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart hot dog on a roller.++++@++++Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?
DREAMS ARE GREAT OR SO IT SEEMS / IF I NEVER FIND ONE I GUESS THAT'S OKAY / I'M HOPIN' FOR A DREAM...++++@++++HOPIN'! HOPIN'!
Few people know that verdict was overturned in the sequel. Heh.++++@++++I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
Yeah, last year I broke it just so the repairman would come. But I'll be fine.++++@++++Hey, um, you gonna be okay?
She took me to a mall and I never saw her again. But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.++++@++++Okay! Okay! I'll stay for one beer.
Please! Please! Please!++++@++++But I promised Marge.
Now I'm sittin' on your shoulders! Please!++++@++++Okay, okay!
And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give youse a gift: I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time.++++@++++Hey, what the--
I never thought I'd say this to someone I cared for, much less my husband, but I'm saying it now: I don't want you here on Christmas.++++@++++Marge, think about what you're saying. It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday!
We already did it!++++@++++The ghost of Marge Future!
Nog stands for "Not Okayed by Government."++++@++++Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
Oh please, stop! Stop it! My religion prohibits me from taking advantage of a fool more than five times. This thing basically has no winners.++++@++++Yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?
You know, ironically, in India, they did use the money for schools and they had fantastic results.++++@++++Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?
Well... those hotdogs began life as Twinkies!++++@++++Wow.
Why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?++++@++++I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly
...airplane that lost its propeller.++++@++++I guess I'll take the Concentration Camp one.
Just 'cause you're here shouldn't make you sad. This is my seventeenth Christmas alone in a movie theater. This is my family. The guy with the smelly pants, the lady that carries empty cans in a PBS tote bag...++++@++++What if I left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?
Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.++++@++++Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say "Jesus."
Well, sir, our good Lord, and my boys are all I've really got. All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through.++++@++++Flanders, are you crying?
Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache.++++@++++Listen. Could I buy a left-handed uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?
Sure... but your eyelashes are long and luxurious already. Are you just buying this to be nice?++++@++++Um. Maybe.
Oh, Homer! Unto us this day, a neighbor is born! But why?++++@++++Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.
Well that curled my lashes, but good for you.++++@++++You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right.
My best friend is a great runner!++++@++++I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.
Not a dream. I work at the mall. And it's closed, so scram.++++@++++Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?
Homie, I'm your present tonight. And the present is that I'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up. Because I realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do. Or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining.++++@++++Oh Marge, you found me! You always find me. Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot.
I thought I had one of those chirping keys.++++@++++Oh, well, I've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best.
Each birth is followed by another birth just seconds later.++++@++++What the? This isn't Halloween!
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?++++@++++No.
Okay, remember we're parked in the "Ethnic Princess" section.++++@++++Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.
Sorry. No outside pacifiers.++++@++++Fine. But I'm not paying for the insurance. Oh, what the hell, give me the insurance.
And your telegrams will be delivered by --++++@++++well, that's it. We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.
Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent!++++@++++I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.
One seat per human!++++@++++Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.
We've left Earth's atmosphere!++++@++++Prove it.
Welcome, humans. There is nothing to fear. I am Kang the Abductor.++++@++++What the? This isn't Halloween.
Whatever you say shall materialize!++++@++++Potato chips!
You mean like Europeans were to the Native Americans? Or the Belgians were to the Congo?++++@++++That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.
Slipped on some drool? Larry H. Zeeblezorp will have you rolling in space credits!++++@++++Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.
Purple landscape... purple trees...++++@++++Yeah, you really went with the purple theme.
All well and good. You obviously exercise.++++@++++See, Marge?
Anything you need? Perhaps you'd care to have your ink gland expressed.++++@++++You're the doctor.
Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!++++@++++Fine.
You're the last vote, Homie.++++@++++'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.
Hey look, Maggie made you a farewell card.++++@++++That kid's got talent, but c'mon!
Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?++++@++++I get it, Lisa. I finally get it.
You do get a last meal.++++@++++I'd like rabbit. Lots of rabbit.
Our elder Klaunax has been chosen for our ceremonial first bite, after which Homer Simpson will be dipped into a spicy cheese fondue.++++@++++Fondue? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.
A transporter beam! Someone is trying to steal our sacrifice!++++@++++Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. So long you stupid slobbering... what the?
We are the resistance. We don't believe in the barbaric consumption of other species.++++@++++So, what do you eat, space broccoli?
Let's go, Homer.++++@++++Where are you taking me?
You are about to behold the secret rebel base.++++@++++Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?
Silence! Homer, we will get you back to Earth.++++@++++What about my family?
Why do you care? It's just your sex mate and spermlings.++++@++++Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you.
Unfortunately, we only had the means to build the spaceship for one. We spent most of our money on the party.++++@++++Well, it is a great party.
The pod is equipped to fulfill your deepest desires. Just concentrate.++++@++++Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.
No I didn't! You licked it off!++++@++++I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
I shall take the first bite. It is quite an honor.++++@++++What's that?
Part of your magnificent behind. We sliced it off when you were sleeping.++++@++++It does look delicious.
Thank God it's just like her busy box.++++@++++I have such a big ass.
The cat ate my heart medicine!++++@++++Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home.
Good ol' Don.++++@++++We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?
Safety Inspector. 7-G.++++@++++But, wait a minute! That's my job!
Yes. Of course it is. There are two of us, and I've been covering for you all these years.++++@++++That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?
But now you won't have me to protect you.++++@++++No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!
How was your day?++++@++++Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?
Oh, sweetie...++++@++++And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick.
There's a Yiddish word for it: "shpilkes."++++@++++They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
Hey, Homer. Carl and I are gonna see if we can sneak out of the men's room without setting off the automatic toilets, ninja-style.++++@++++Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!
Simpson! I want a full plant status report at five o'clock.++++@++++Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?
I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.++++@++++It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.++++@++++No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?
None.++++@++++What?! When were you gonna tell me?
Homie... workaholic is probably your best "aholic" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday.++++@++++The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid.
I thought you were going to try to relax.++++@++++How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
I knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.++++@++++What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
Shhh!++++@++++Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
Homer, I have to use the Porta Potty.++++@++++Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
Hey Dad, since we've gotta wait, can't we please see an act?++++@++++Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
I need a new volunteer. How about you, sir?++++@++++Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!
You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient.++++@++++Okay.
Now we've never met, have we, sir?++++@++++Ooh, patter!
Do you have any children?++++@++++No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three.
When I snap my fingers you shall be ten years old.++++@++++Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack...
You are ten years old.++++@++++No I'm not.
Yes you are.++++@++++No I'm not.
Yes, yes you are.++++@++++Yes you are.
Look, I said, you are.++++@++++Yeah you are too.
I'm not convinced.++++@++++I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!
Now I'm gonna test just how deeply Homer's mind has been affected. Take a sip of this, young man.++++@++++Ew! Gross!
I'm saying he so desperately needs to believe he's ten, that only the original hypnotist who did this can undo the trance without risking permanent damage to Homer's psyche.++++@++++Help... help me.
Dear God!++++@++++Psych!
Then can we get pizza on the way home?++++@++++Ask for boogers on Bart's half!
Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room. And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad.++++@++++Um, Mrs. Simpson?
Homer, can't you sleep with Mom?++++@++++I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
If I'm gonna get through this day, I better Irish up my coffee.++++@++++I'm ready to go to school.
Homer... you're not going to school.++++@++++I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?
Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes. You're "it"!++++@++++Can I play?
Yeah! Listen, Homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up?++++@++++Why you little--
Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?++++@++++Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.
Not right now.++++@++++Well, that's everything I know that girls like.
Listen, Homer. I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me.++++@++++Okay.
Me too. And you know what? I'm afraid you might... change back.++++@++++Change back to what?
Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.++++@++++Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?
Homer, come here.++++@++++Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever.
You are back!++++@++++- parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!
Well, here's what happened...++++@++++Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?
Homie, I've missed you!++++@++++Ooh! I've missed you too.
Recommended by a kid I used to know.++++@++++Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid.
You think so?++++@++++The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.
Well... maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.++++@++++You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new.
Get lost.++++@++++Why you little...?!
Oh, so good to have you back.++++@++++It's good to be back.
A bald eagle!++++@++++It is!
Homer, quick! Get your shooing broom!++++@++++Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!
No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.++++@++++Um...
Or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.++++@++++Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!
Squawky?++++@++++Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.
Squawky, until I met you, I never thought I could love something bald.++++@++++Bye!
Hello. I'm Elon Musk.++++@++++Die!
Dad no! Elon Musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!++++@++++You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!
His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives!++++@++++And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.
What did bring me to Springfield? Well, to start with, I'm an idea man. It's my raison d'Ãªtre.++++@++++Mmm, raisin detra.
That's so sad. Maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to...++++@++++Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.
I am! And I will!++++@++++Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.
Homer, if we're gonna carpool together, there's one thing you have to know.++++@++++"Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free." It's as old as the Bible.
No, it's that I don't talk to anyone unless they provide the mental stimulation I seek.++++@++++Ditto.
Oh wow! That's an idea! White meatballs. Synthetic meat that you can print from your printer. Say something else. Please, now!++++@++++Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!
Tase... bro... chocolate rain. Use electroplating to remove metal ions from rainwater, making it suitable for drinking!++++@++++What about the chocolate?
Well, come on, keep throwing things at me.++++@++++Um...
Oh! This is a break! We're-- we're taking a break!++++@++++I gotcha!
You're fun!++++@++++Well duh!
What are you writing? Share, buddy.++++@++++Suggestion for the "suggestion box."
Can anyone make a suggestion?++++@++++Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em.
Well, you'll need to increase the capacity of your plant. You cover the costs, you get a hundred percent of the profits.++++@++++Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears.
Exactly! Exactly! What if we make the cream cup out of sugar so it dissolves in the coffee?++++@++++Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug.
Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.++++@++++Well, I'm not one for just talking.
You're welllcome...++++@++++You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.
Tell Musk there's more where that came from.++++@++++More of what?
What's wrong Homer? Is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?++++@++++No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?
Here's what you do. You just take his hand, look in his eyes and say "I don't want to be with you anymore."++++@++++Wow, you're good at that.
Whatever you want we'll make it work. Right, Homer?++++@++++Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen.
No!!!++++@++++I don't want to be with you anymore.
Can I ask why?++++@++++I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I.
It's okay. I'll be fine.++++@++++It's on your face too!
I just wanted to see if there was a better life. Even for a little bit.++++@++++When you're sixteen I'll drive you to Cincinnati. And you'll see what there is to see.
What's wrong, Dad?++++@++++Nothing.
Elon's log. Earthdate 25 January 2015. I have left Springfield forever. But there are some things I will definitely miss.++++@++++The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet..
Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by... former Mayor Moleman!++++@++++I met a guy. A wonderful guy.
Hyah!++++@++++Boy. Sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.
Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom.++++@++++Simpler time.
I think we might just make a good team. Like Maggie and Grampa.++++@++++What are you doing?
What's it look like? Writing a song.++++@++++Artists.
Oh, thank you, Homie!++++@++++Thank you, roll of masking tape!
Our kids just did something amazing!++++@++++Well, not Maggie.
Get up!++++@++++Okay, okay. Standing O or die!
That's not a healthy way to lose weight.++++@++++It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy.
You don't have to do this alone.++++@++++What the?
No-no. In fact, quite the opposite. We are "Big is Beautiful."++++@++++So... you guys are proud of what you are?
We do not cower in the shadows. We make the shadows!++++@++++Do you guys serve snacks?
Mustn't forget the diet soda!++++@++++I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?
If I may...++++@++++Ooh, labels.
Our loved ones, though precious, can often be a hurdle.++++@++++Who are you?
We never use the word "fat" here.++++@++++Sorry.
My dear fat friend, all your wife needs is a little education. Now, repeat after me... I am big.++++@++++I am big.
I am beautiful.++++@++++I have a beauty of a sort to some.
No one can make me feel bad about who I am because this is who I am.++++@++++Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy.
Well that's great, Homie. Just let me finish uploading this photo.++++@++++No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!
Thank you, Lord. And I'll give up online scrapbooking like I promised.++++@++++They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am.
That's worse than what I thought!++++@++++Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale.
What about Mr. Two Belts?++++@++++Good. Good. By which I mean bad, bad.
What? You're kiddin'.++++@++++We never dreamed.
WE'RE BIG! WE'RE PROUD! TWO OF US CAN MAKE A CROWD!++++@++++Sorry, fellas. There's a movement I have to join. I've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating.
Homer, you have to choose. And I think the choice is clear.++++@++++Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts.
No more judgment. No more jokes. We will not be made to feel less than because we are greater than.++++@++++I was distinctly promised no math!
Oh, kids, stop arguing. Or keep arguing. I don't care. Homer, I'm sorry I tried to help you control your weight. I'm not sure of anything anymore. Sorry I ever open my mouth.++++@++++Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert.
How can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?++++@++++Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men.
Much more!++++@++++Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself.
That's not really what I was--++++@++++It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home.
It's because everything you love, you love so much.++++@++++And because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right.
You finally reached emotional maturity. Unlike Bart.++++@++++Marge! Stop that crazy thing!
You're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? How much have you had?++++@++++Woo hoo! Off the hook!
Looks like this is all me.++++@++++Yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?
I can't close down the bar on a Saturday. That's when you guys can drink 'cause you're not workin' for three days.++++@++++Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.
I am woman, hear me pour! Oh yeah!++++@++++There's no guys! We haven't made any money.
You can't mean that!++++@++++We don't look at you that way.
Hey, wait a minute! We can get you a job! There's an opening at the nuclear plant 'cause of that guy that defected to North Korea.++++@++++Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.
We are gonna search this place from top to bottom.++++@++++That's where all the problems are!
Huh... no one was in there.++++@++++Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want.
Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holdin' up a sofa that was missin' a leg.++++@++++Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?
Smithers, what profit a man if he gain the world and lose his soul. Seriously. I need an amount. In round dollars.++++@++++Plant-watering guy.
Yes, yes, go ahead. And be careful with the Venus flytrap!++++@++++All right.
They say you catch more flies with honey. I say with flytraps!++++@++++What do I do now?
Just lean into it. It'll be over soon, one way or another.++++@++++Oh, all right.
Now they won't even have lunch with me.++++@++++Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school.
Oh, now you gotta throw your grade school education in my face?!++++@++++You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer.
Homer Simpson. Working with those plants is great! It's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.++++@++++Feminine?!
How come there's never a "Take Your Son To Work Day?"++++@++++'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. The Dirty Dozen? All guys. Twelve Angry Men? Men! The X-Men? Mostly men.
Is it called the cooling tower because there's--++++@++++Not my department.
But what about the presentation? The eyes taste first, then lips, then palate, then the body's harshest critic, the colon.++++@++++Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!
Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.++++@++++Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?
No. I want to go out. I am twenty-five years old.++++@++++Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project.
Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out.++++@++++Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!
I want to go out, and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies.++++@++++I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?
Yes! I've dreamed of...++++@++++All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.
So, all these concubines belong to this one tyrant?++++@++++He's called "The Bachelor."
Please let me go out.++++@++++All right, Princess. I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital F.
Eh, you gotta be mad at something.++++@++++Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.
Now, guess how much of the twenty million I saw?++++@++++Eight million?
Ze-ro.++++@++++Get outta here!
If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!++++@++++She's gone!
And she trashed my bar! Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her.++++@++++Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!
Lost African princess, eh? Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser.++++@++++Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.
Uh, hello, Simpson. Just checking up. May I speak with the princess?++++@++++Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee.
Just relax and enjoy the music.++++@++++Moe Szyslak!
And as for you, your punishment will be...++++@++++Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?
A woman has allowed you to sire her children?++++@++++There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.
Majesty.++++@++++And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve.
I am not convinced.++++@++++...uh, because you want them to grow...
Still not convinced.++++@++++...and because you can't strangle a girl.
God doesn't hear my prayers. If he did, I'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper.++++@++++Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn.
Yeah, so, uh, I'm going out to rehearse... the revue.++++@++++Go, go make magic. You just go.
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue.++++@++++What are the skits about?
Uh... pop culture and current events.++++@++++How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
Both.++++@++++Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one.
Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. It's called "Cats and Dogs."++++@++++You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show.
Homie, Homie, I can finally tell you how we really got the money...++++@++++Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else.
This is all my fault.++++@++++Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, "Cats and Dogs" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL
Mom's counting cards at the casino!++++@++++If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!
This is your wife?++++@++++Do you know where she is?
Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions in our "beating room."++++@++++All right, as long as it's just questions.
We just want the money your wife stole from us.++++@++++Stole? How is counting cards stealing?
Well, it's not really stealing.++++@++++Is it even cheating?
No, but-- it's just not allowed.++++@++++I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?
I can't take any more of this guy. Get the vise.++++@++++I knew you had a vise! I knew it!
You are free to leave as long as your faith-based card counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino.++++@++++No deal!
But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.++++@++++No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
Homie, after all this, do you still believe in God?++++@++++On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?
Ooo, careful, Homer.++++@++++There's no time to be careful.
Sorry, Excuse us. Pardon me...++++@++++Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred.
And now, presenting Lisa Simpson, as Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas.++++@++++Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours.
The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene from Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol".++++@++++How many grades does this school have?
Marge, please.++++@++++It's your sister.
"Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."++++@++++Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?
...Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays.++++@++++Marge!
The Simpsons.++++@++++Marge, where's the extension cord?
Oh, for heavens sakes, Homer. It's in the utility drawer.++++@++++Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
A tattoo!++++@++++A what!
You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.++++@++++Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.
May I please speak to Marge?++++@++++This is her sister, isn't it?
Just hold your horses, son. Hey, hey, Simpson.++++@++++What is it, Flanders?
Oh. Neat-o.++++@++++It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off.
Go get your money.++++@++++Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money?
You can look now.++++@++++Oh! Big jar this year.
One more thing: Merry Christmas.++++@++++Oh, thank God for the big jar.
Ow! Quit it!++++@++++Hey! What's with this?
But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.++++@++++It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.
I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer.++++@++++Oh. I love you, Marge.
Homer, you tell me that all the time.++++@++++Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but...++++@++++Marge, well, let me be honest with you.
Ow. Oh, Simpson, it's you.++++@++++Hello, Flanders.
Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?++++@++++Well, let's see.
This one's mine. And this one's mine. This one's mine... and this--++++@++++They're all yours.
Hey, Mr. Simpson. You dropped your pork chop.++++@++++Gimme that!
What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lumpa coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long.++++@++++So?
So it's Christmas!++++@++++Thanks, Moe.
Drinks all around!++++@++++What's with the crazy getup, Barn?
I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall.++++@++++Wow. Can I do that?
Do you like children?++++@++++What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?
What is it now, Simpson?++++@++++Huh, when do we get paid?
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.++++@++++Dasher, Dancer...
Um-hmm.++++@++++Prancer...
Sit down, Simpson.++++@++++And what would you like, little boy?
You're not really Santa, tubby.++++@++++Why you little eggheaded...!
No, no, Homer. If such an emergency arises, just tell them Santa's very busy this time of year and you're one of his helpers.++++@++++Oh, I knew that one, too.
Homer! Why are you seven hours late?++++@++++Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub.
Oh, it's Christmas? You wouldn't know it around here.++++@++++And why is that?
Well, for one thing, there's no tree.++++@++++Well, I was just on my way out to get one.
Can we?++++@++++No!
Hey, you. What do you think you're doing?++++@++++Uh-oh.
Why is there a birdhouse in it?++++@++++That's an ornament.
And then I want some Robotoids... and then I want a Goop Monster... and then I want a great big, giant...++++@++++Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut.
I hope you feel better, Santa.++++@++++I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid.
Hey Santa, what's shaking?++++@++++What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?
Here?++++@++++I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick.
Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you.++++@++++Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything.
I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low.++++@++++Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do.
That's right. One hundred and twenty dollars gross, less social security --++++@++++Yeah.
Less unemployment insurance --++++@++++But...
Less Santa training --++++@++++Santa?
Less costume purchase --++++@++++Wait a minute...
Less beard rental, less Christmas club.++++@++++But... but...
Come on, Dad. Let's go home.++++@++++Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
All right! Thirteen big ones. Springfield Downs, here I come.++++@++++What?
You heard me. I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Wanna come?++++@++++Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- "Santa's Little Helper". It's a sign! It's an omen!
Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank.++++@++++Uh-uh.
Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us.++++@++++Well, okay. Let's go.
WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE'RE IN THE MONEY / WE GOT A LOT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ALONG.++++@++++I can't believe I'm doing this.
Number six. That's our lucky dog, right over there. He's won his last five races.++++@++++What! That scrawny little bag of bones?
Come on, Dad. They're all scrawny little bags of bones.++++@++++Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.
Ninety nine to one.++++@++++Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!
I got a bad feeling about this.++++@++++Don't you believe in me, son?
Uh...++++@++++Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.
Oh, go for it, Dad.++++@++++That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.
Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santa's Little Helper! Run baby run!++++@++++Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!
And coming up on the left is "Quadruped", followed by Dog O' War and "Fido".++++@++++Go! Go!
Go Santa's Little Helper!++++@++++Come on, boy.
It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.++++@++++I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
And don't come back!++++@++++Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh.
Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?++++@++++But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
I'll pay! How much?++++@++++All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make.
This should be good.++++@++++I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't --
This is the best gift of all, Homer.++++@++++It is?
What's his name?++++@++++Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.
Like a light bulb!++++@++++Bart!
Like Shine-ola!++++@++++Lisa!
Like strip poker!++++@++++I'm warning you two!
Take it, Homer!++++@++++RUDOLPH WITH YOUR NOSE... OVER HERE... / SO YOU CAN GUIDE MY SLEIGH TODAY....
Nurturing.++++@++++Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
Id. Triple word score.++++@++++Hey! No abbreviations!
As in, "this game is stup-id."++++@++++Hey, shut up, boy.
We could look this "id" thing up in the dictionary.++++@++++We got one?
"Id. Along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."++++@++++Get outta here.
Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.++++@++++Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
And a short temper.++++@++++I'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.++++@++++That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this! "I am a weiner." He sure is!
Hello again, Principal Skinner.++++@++++What have you done this time, boy?
I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.++++@++++Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?
That was the idea.++++@++++Oh.
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.++++@++++What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child".++++@++++A what?
No, no, we're quite certain. The child is not supposed to know his own I.Q., of course, but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.++++@++++Nine hundred and twelve?
Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's two hundred and sixteen.++++@++++Oh.
Sign me up, Doc.++++@++++Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.
I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.++++@++++Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?
You're stifling my creativity, Dad.++++@++++Sorry, boy.
Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?++++@++++Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.++++@++++Gotcha!
Oh, no. Ties.++++@++++Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight.++++@++++Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.
Os-os.++++@++++What?
That's backwards for so-so.++++@++++Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?
Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?++++@++++But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
There's no guy with peanuts, dear.++++@++++Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...
Bart, stop fooling around. Homer, stop encouraging him.++++@++++Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him.
Who are those people?++++@++++P.U. When is this over?
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.++++@++++Is that one fat enough for you, son?
The what?++++@++++Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.
Oh, no.++++@++++Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.++++@++++Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.
Whoa! Strike two! Two and two!++++@++++Can you still see the ball, Bart?
Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that fast.++++@++++Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat.
Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're outta there.++++@++++So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?
I had a little accident in chemistry today.++++@++++Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son.
Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you won't be too mad...++++@++++What is it, son?
I'm not a genius, Dad.++++@++++What?
I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.++++@++++Why, you little -- !
Oh, well.++++@++++You can't stay in there forever!
I can try.++++@++++March your butt right out here. Now!
No way, man!++++@++++But -- son, if you don't come out I can't "hug" you... and "kiss you"... and make you feel all better.
Hey, you guys look hot.++++@++++Nothin's easy.
Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around on your butt and stuffing your face they'd take them on a tour of your house.++++@++++You're right! I gotta get where the action is!
Woo! Woo! I'm up here!++++@++++Oh, hi, boy!
I might have known it was you, Simpson.++++@++++But, sir, I --
Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.++++@++++Those perfectionists? Forget it.
How 'bout this: Supervising Technician at the toxic waste dump.++++@++++I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.
Yeah, go for it, Dad.++++@++++You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come.
Ahh, I don't know. He's tough to catch. He keeps changing his name.++++@++++Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?
I don't think you're ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.++++@++++Oh.
Are you all right, Homer?++++@++++I'm fine. I'm just thinking.
Well, I've been thinking, too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted.++++@++++You think you can still do that kind of work?
YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT WONDERFUL DUFF / DUFF BEER.++++@++++Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.
Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you.++++@++++Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign.
Oh, yeah?++++@++++Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --
Simpson, get to the point!++++@++++I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --
Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee and maple logs in the lobby.++++@++++Wow. They listened to me.
You did it, Homer.++++@++++Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.
Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you.++++@++++Proud. Proud of what?
Well, everything. Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road.++++@++++Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.
What, Dad?++++@++++I'm talking about that!
Gee, Dad's a hero.++++@++++What did you say, son?
Burns wants to talk to you, privately.++++@++++Privately?
Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.++++@++++Same here.
Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.++++@++++Sorry, no can do!
Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.++++@++++Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.
Simpson! Time's up!++++@++++Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.++++@++++What?
Go, Dad!++++@++++Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --
You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?++++@++++Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.
You've got the job. Now get to work.++++@++++I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!++++@++++Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.++++@++++You were? Aw, well go ahead.
No I don't!++++@++++Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.
Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.++++@++++Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word "bonehead".
Excellent!++++@++++Afternoon, Mr. Burns.
Ah... Hello, there, uh... uh...++++@++++Simpson, Homer.
Bart.++++@++++Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.
Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.++++@++++Why you, listen to me you...
Trouble, Simpson?++++@++++No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.
Hey Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!++++@++++Be normal! Be normal!
Hey, isn't that your boy there, torturing the swans?++++@++++Bart!
Ooops!++++@++++Gotcha!
Whoa careful, Dad. Blow a gasket and you lose your job.++++@++++Marge! Knock it off!
Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it.++++@++++Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!
Hey brother, pour the wine.++++@++++Marge, I need you.
Hey Homie. Did you try the punch?++++@++++Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!
Well, I'm not much of a drinker...++++@++++Well, you picked a perfect time to start.
Musicians, cease that infernal tutlitating. "Thank you all..." "...for coming."++++@++++Wahhhhhhhhh!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Sorry. Sorry.++++@++++Marge!
Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant.++++@++++Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.
Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid!++++@++++Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss.
I pity you.++++@++++Why?
Happy, Dad?++++@++++Yes.
Good. Commence shovelling.++++@++++No. We're going to say grace first.
Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub.++++@++++No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?
Amen. Let's eat.++++@++++No! I'm not done yet.
But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?++++@++++I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
The sad truth is all families are like us.++++@++++You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me.
Look, napkins.++++@++++Yahhhhhhhh!
They're having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.++++@++++I wish I could hear what they're saying.
Where's he going?++++@++++Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
Whoa, look at this place. What a dump.++++@++++It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
Are you coming in, Homer?++++@++++No, no. I want to be alone with my thought.
The fans are getting just a little bit anxious here folks...++++@++++Another beer, Moe.
Hey! What's gotten into Bobo?++++@++++I've got some wieners in my pocket.
Don't blame yourself, Homer. You got dealt a bad hand. You got crummy little kids that nobody can control.++++@++++You can't talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them.
Why? You got two I haven't met?++++@++++Why, you... Here's five you haven't met.
All-Star Boxing is brought to you by "Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center".++++@++++Huh... what?
Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. 1-800-555-HUGS. Why don't you call... Right now?++++@++++When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!
Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV?++++@++++Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.
The fat guy on TV?++++@++++Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference.
Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?++++@++++Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars.
But we don't have that kind of money.++++@++++Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund.
...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.++++@++++That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.++++@++++Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice.
Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?++++@++++Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here.
Afternoon, Simpson. So what can I do for you?++++@++++Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?
Is it cable-ready?++++@++++Ready as she'll ever be!
All our money, the college funds, the TV. Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.++++@++++Hey, no pain, no gain.
. Will you be paying by cash or check?++++@++++Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones.
If you really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where our TV used to be.++++@++++Bart!
We would if we had one.++++@++++Lisa!
Homer, what have you got for us? Homer?++++@++++Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
Whoa! Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.++++@++++Good idea.
Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.++++@++++Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.++++@++++Unortho what?
Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--++++@++++Arrrgh!
Just testing.++++@++++Why you...
You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?++++@++++Oh, yes, doctor.
No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go.++++@++++Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!
five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here.++++@++++Wow! Five hundred smackers!
Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?++++@++++That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
Uh-uh, Homer. Lisa's making these for her teacher.++++@++++Ah. Say no more.
Keep your greasy mitts outta there.++++@++++No.
Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...++++@++++Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.
I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher.++++@++++Surely, Lisa. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there.
Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.++++@++++Yeah, right, Lis. It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and...
Thanks, Bart. We got the day off from school for this.++++@++++Yeah, and I got the day off from work.
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.++++@++++Tough day at school, boy?
Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.++++@++++So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won.
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.++++@++++Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something.
Dad... I need help... Please...++++@++++Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears.
A bully?!++++@++++Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.
I guess I could do that.++++@++++What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
What on earth are you talking about, Homer?++++@++++The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?
What do you mean, Mom?++++@++++Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.
That's why he lashes out at the world.++++@++++Aw, Marge.
So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.++++@++++Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.
You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?++++@++++Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
I got 'im.++++@++++You, up in the tree! The tall grayÂ­ haired kid! Get your butt down here right now!
Wow, sounds good to me. Okay. I'll sign.++++@++++What about you, boy?
Sorry, Dad. Women and children first.++++@++++Wha' th--
Did you check the den?++++@++++The den! Great idea!
Warm... no, cold... colder... Ice cold.++++@++++Do you know where my keys are?
Did you try the rumpus room?++++@++++Rumpus room. Great idea!
Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to keep him...++++@++++Bart!
Oh yeah!++++@++++All right. Hey, hey!
In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...++++@++++Must you do this every time?
And Homer is down! Three seconds, folks -- a new record!++++@++++Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!
Yo, chump, you back again?++++@++++Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!
But they sent a note from school.++++@++++What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.
Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa.++++@++++Lisa?
It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.++++@++++Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like "my stomach hurts" or "I'm going crazy". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?
I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?++++@++++Well... eh... er...eh...
Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.++++@++++Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.++++@++++You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!
Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong.++++@++++In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!
Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.++++@++++No.
Exactly, come to the one you love.++++@++++Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.
Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.++++@++++I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!
I was just playing the blues... ...Dad.++++@++++Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.
No, that's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.++++@++++Let's hear it.
Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.++++@++++What th...
I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.++++@++++No, Bart, no.
Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.++++@++++You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?
Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman.++++@++++Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.
Fire officials said the two-alarm blaze took them more than an hour to get under control.++++@++++Oh, no, Marge!
No, I'm very upset.++++@++++Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!
I'm upset about Lisa.++++@++++Oh. Me, too.
Me three. What are we talking about?++++@++++Bart!
It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry.++++@++++Hey, that kid's pretty good.
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!++++@++++No, me! No, Me!
I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog.++++@++++You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.++++@++++That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight.
And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself!++++@++++Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man.++++@++++Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.
All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.++++@++++Oh! Oh! Block it.
Boys, I'd like your attention, please.++++@++++Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.
"I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."++++@++++What?
Wow, man! What an RV!++++@++++Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?
It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof?++++@++++A satellite dish!
Yes indeedilly-doodily.++++@++++But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.
Simple, Simpson. Credit.++++@++++Oooh! Credit.
We're just browsing, thank you.++++@++++I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth.++++@++++Where is it?
I'm not sure that we can afford...++++@++++Does it have a deep fryer?
This is better than our house!++++@++++Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
It all seems so expensive...++++@++++Hey, how much is it?
You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?++++@++++Yeah, how much is it?
Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face.++++@++++You do?
Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?++++@++++No.
I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.++++@++++Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says.++++@++++Oh.
It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.++++@++++Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon.++++@++++How much do you want for it?
This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this.++++@++++I swear it Bob.
This is you and me?++++@++++Yeah!
In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?++++@++++On my honor.
Three-fifty a month.++++@++++Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?
Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?++++@++++Yeah!
He's buying this. Did you know that?++++@++++No.
Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?++++@++++All right. All right! I'll take it.
Oooh, She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations, Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun.++++@++++Jealous. Everybody ready?
I hate this. I don't want to go.++++@++++that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!
Dad's feet.++++@++++Bart!
You win, Bart.++++@++++Lisa!
Are we there yet, dad?++++@++++I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.
Homer, I'm telling you this is not the Interstate.++++@++++Pfft. Maps.
Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?++++@++++Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
My feet are getting wet!++++@++++Ah, come on. We're going back to nature.
Yes!!!++++@++++All righty.
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!++++@++++Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One...
You mean like we just did?++++@++++Will somebody help her?
Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?++++@++++Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Five finger discount, man.++++@++++Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.++++@++++Shut up!
It is?++++@++++Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax.
Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.++++@++++That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.
There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?++++@++++Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
It's a deal.++++@++++And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not...++++@++++Run, you fool!
Don't have a cow, Dad.++++@++++What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
I'm not the only one, Homeboy.++++@++++What? Oooh! Jungle Man!
Yeah, man.++++@++++Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town.
But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man.++++@++++Ah food. Good thinking, son.
What are we going to do, hang ourselves?++++@++++No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.
G-g-good night, D-dad.++++@++++G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight.
Are we ever going to be there?++++@++++How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!
How is it?++++@++++Tangy.
Ahhhhhhh!++++@++++Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!
Bigfoot. The legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend. He's very very real. What you are about to see is unedited video footage taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of Tenderfoot Gorge.++++@++++Plemk heh feh.
Arewethereyet Arewethereyet Arewethereyet?++++@++++Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!
What do we do, Dad?++++@++++Praise the grizzles son.
Nice grizzles.++++@++++Maggie! Oh my little girl!
Dad! Oh Dad!++++@++++Avenge me, son. Avenge my death.
Last weeks capture of bigfoot has turned into the scientific poser of the century. Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains. Who was this Homer? Was it man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot?++++@++++Can I have some apple sauce?
The glimmer of the eyes. What about the sloping apelike forehead?++++@++++Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, fraulein, please. Zis much ve can agree upon: The specimen is either a below average human being or a brilliant beast.++++@++++Ooh, those stupid eggheads.
No, dad. This whole thing was my fault. You run along.++++@++++No!
Aw, dad.++++@++++We'll die together, like a father and son should.
Phillips has broken free. He's at the 45, 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.++++@++++Oh no.
Touchdown.++++@++++No!
A 64 yard run. We've got an upset in the making!++++@++++No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh!
Oh Homer, you promised me...++++@++++This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch.
They're kicking off. Wolodarsky takes it to the five and -- Oh my! He fumbles.++++@++++Oh no!
Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.++++@++++Where is it. The game... where is it?
All right Kogen's got Wolodarsky open in the end zone. He throws it.++++@++++Catch it! catch it!
It's complete. Touchdown!++++@++++All right!
This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose from the dead.++++@++++Lazar who?
Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer? ... Homer?++++@++++Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!
Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?++++@++++Maybe.
Now, they're lining up for this crucial kick. One final tick of the clock remains. If they win, it will cap an amazing comeback. But it's a 49 yard field goal into the wind.++++@++++Make it, make it, make it, make it.
The kick is up. It's got the distance. Holy toledo, it's good!++++@++++Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
I was pleased you enjoyed it. I seem to have struck a cord with you today, Homer.++++@++++What? Oh yeah. You were great.
Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to.++++@++++What was it about?
Gambling.++++@++++Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?
Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.++++@++++What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
Our teacher.++++@++++I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?
No way, Jose.++++@++++Marge. They're only space mutants.
Hey, Dad. Can I have five bucks?++++@++++I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
Perish the thought.++++@++++Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say.
Go ahead, Bart. Tell them. It's the head of Jebediah Springfield.++++@++++Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?
Dad, can I talk to you about something?++++@++++Sure, boy. What's on your mind?
Well... I was wondering... how important is it to be popular?++++@++++I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world.
So like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?++++@++++You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?
Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.++++@++++Ooooh, that's some ball.
It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.++++@++++Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?
Mom, Dad.++++@++++I knew it all along.
Why, Bart, why?++++@++++Yeah? Why you little...
Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that?++++@++++Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree.
Homer, did you have something to do with this?++++@++++Well, maybe I am a little responsible.
A little?++++@++++C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.
The feeling is more than mutual, sir.++++@++++Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice.
Happy birthday!++++@++++Huh? Whuh?
Well, isn't this nice?++++@++++My birthday?
You don't even know your own wife's birthday?++++@++++Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didn't you?
Yeah, what'd you get?++++@++++Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.
Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin.++++@++++Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers.
And the kids.++++@++++Fair enough.
Someone who eats with his mouth shut.++++@++++What's that, Patty?
What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.++++@++++Bart!
Oh, brother.++++@++++Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY THIRTY-FOURTH BIRTHDAY, MRS. HOMER SIMPSON... / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOO!++++@++++Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?
Well, it's hard for me to judge since I've never bowled in my life.++++@++++Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.++++@++++What? No...
The holes were drilled for your fingers.++++@++++I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?
You never intended for me to use that ball.++++@++++Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.
You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.++++@++++So you'd know it's from me!
Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.++++@++++What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.++++@++++Well... you're welcome.
Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us.++++@++++Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?
My compliments to the delivery boy.++++@++++Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.
Homer... Homer.++++@++++Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?
It's a very challenging hobby.++++@++++Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.
Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.++++@++++Oh? You're going back?
Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?++++@++++Uh, no, I don't mind.
Good night, Homer.++++@++++'Night.
Oh! Oh! Well, all right.++++@++++Marge?
What, Homer?++++@++++Nothing.
Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?++++@++++Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
Dad, you didn't even say ouch.++++@++++Oh, sorry... ouch!
Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.++++@++++I gave you advice? Get outta here.
Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse.++++@++++Hmm. Good advice.
Ain't you hungry, Homer?++++@++++Starving.
Then why aren't you eating your sandwich?++++@++++How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left.
So how was the office birthday party?++++@++++Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.
Does this girl like him?++++@++++Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.
Don't strain yourself, dear.++++@++++Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.
Homer, is this some kind of stag party?++++@++++No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.
Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?++++@++++No, my supervisor.
Hey don't worry. Things are gonna pick up once the... entertainment gets here.++++@++++Oooh... entertainment.
Hey, try and keep it down guys, okay?++++@++++Hey, shut up!
How do I tell you this, my boy? We're in hell.++++@++++Ooh, look at him squirm.
Go for it, Homer!++++@++++I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this.
Wow, man.++++@++++Oh, this is the most fun I've had in my whole life.
You look familiar, sir. Are you on the television or something?++++@++++Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
Hey, hey! Lookin' good!++++@++++What are you on, pal?
Hey, mister! Doo doo doo doo doo, doo dee doo dee doo dee doo...++++@++++Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!
Hey hey hey!++++@++++I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!
What is the meaning of this?++++@++++I-it's meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir.
Hey, my photo!++++@++++Your photo?
Uh oh.++++@++++Why you little --
I'm outta here.++++@++++Look Marge... honey... baby doll... I...
Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now.++++@++++What are you saying, Honey?
My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.++++@++++Would a motel be okay?
What's the matter, Homer? Hottest Ladies Night in months and you're not even checking out the action.++++@++++Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture.
So where you staying tonight, Homer?++++@++++Motel, I guess.
If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's an open beer in the fridge.++++@++++Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on.
Hello, Marge, you left your damn porch light on.++++@++++Barney!
Who is this?++++@++++Don't listen to him, Marge, he's...
Homer, yo-you're overwrought. Why don't you unwind a little bit? Party down the hall. You know this apartment complex caters to upscale young singles like me.++++@++++No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed.
Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Report at once to Mr. Burns' office.++++@++++Oh no.
What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?++++@++++What do you mean, sir?
A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!++++@++++It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?
Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.++++@++++Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.
Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.++++@++++I don't really know, sir.
Welcome back, Dad.++++@++++How's your Mom?
Yeah, good luck, man.++++@++++Oh, thanks, boy.
Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.++++@++++Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.++++@++++Oh, he does not!
Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.++++@++++So what should I do, Marge?
Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.++++@++++Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...
Just let me say that it is an honor to have Springfield's number-one swinger with us to--++++@++++Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?
Oh. Oh, hi.++++@++++Oooo.
Places, ladies! Take your places! Can I get just a little cooperation. It's showtime!++++@++++Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.++++@++++Could you tell him a little about yourself?
Well, um... my real name's Shawna Tifton, my pet peeve is rude people. And my turn ons include silk sheets and a warm fire place.++++@++++Thank you very much ma'am. We'll be out of your...
Get out of my cage! My boss will freak out.++++@++++Oh no.
OH, I COULD LOVE A MILLION GIRLS/ EVERY GIRL IN BETWEEN/ YEAH, I COULD LOVE A CHINESE GIRL AN ESKIMO OR FIN...++++@++++Ahhhhhh!
Mister Mistro... OH, I COULD LOVE A MILLION GIRLS/ EVERY GIRL IN BETWEEN/ YEAH, I COULD LOVE A CHINESE GIRL AN ESKIMO OR FIN/ I COULD DIG A DEUCHLAND CHICK A GIRL WITH GOLDEN CURL/ IN FACT I THINK THAT WE COULD LOVE...++++@++++ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.
Way to go dad!++++@++++Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!
I like to play with you. I like to play with you. I like to play with you.++++@++++My back! There goes my back again!
Homer! What happened?++++@++++The boy. Bring me the boy.
Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow?++++@++++Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?
Well... okay.++++@++++Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
I know how you like 'em, Homer.++++@++++And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup.
Homer, Principal Skinner's here.++++@++++Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.
Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory.++++@++++That old gag.
Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?++++@++++Hear him out, Marge.
Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.++++@++++Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.
Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.++++@++++Yeah, but what about Bart?
I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.++++@++++Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?
Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.++++@++++You mean all white with pink eyes?
Way to go!++++@++++Bon voyage, boy.
I know I'm going and you're not.++++@++++I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
Mmm-hmm. Well, come along.++++@++++Goodbye, Bart.
'Bye. We miss you.++++@++++Be good.
You know, in Albania the unit of currency is called the lek.++++@++++You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?
And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.++++@++++Give me the old stars and stripes.
And the main export is furious political thought.++++@++++Political what?
And this must be Lisa and Maggie... and you must be my new father, Homer.++++@++++Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he?
Can, too.++++@++++Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.
Oh. Okay.++++@++++Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
Yes, thank you, Father.++++@++++Look, Adil. You can call me Dad.
All right, Dad.++++@++++Aww. You called me dad.
Dad, do you think I could come visit you at the nuclear power plant?++++@++++You want to see where I work?
Oh, yes, very much.++++@++++None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
Then I can go?++++@++++Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.
Dad, do you think I might see your plutonium isolation module?++++@++++Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.
Yeah, over in Sector Twelve.++++@++++Sector Twelve?
Third floor by the candy machines.++++@++++Oh, that Sector Twelve.
Ungrateful swine! We give you food, we give you shelter, and this is how you repay us.++++@++++You little shutterbug.
You sure have taken a shine to little Adil.++++@++++Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that.
Well, okay, I will. If you admit you love Bart.++++@++++Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well...
Oh... Adil's a very sweet boy.++++@++++Darn tootin'.
Hello, Homer. What's that?++++@++++Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.
Oh, my.++++@++++Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out.
Well, sir... Well, sir, we've been on the trail of a spy transmitting highly confidential information to an unfriendly nation.++++@++++Oooo.
Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point.++++@++++Wow!
That's all I can tell you.++++@++++Aw!
All right. Well, the name of his country starts with the letter "A".++++@++++Hmmm.
Time's up, Sparrow. We're coming in after you.++++@++++Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this.
The Sparrow!++++@++++Adil! Oh... there you are.
Goodbye Adil. Have a nice trip.++++@++++Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted.
Hey, where's the big guy?++++@++++He needs me. Hey, boy.
Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us.++++@++++Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle.
My father. What a buffoon.++++@++++Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French.
Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could pick up a half gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work.++++@++++Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?
Hello, steady customer. How are you this evening, sir?++++@++++How you doin', Apu?
What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.++++@++++The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome."
Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy....++++@++++Sorry, pal...
Well, it is a simple charcoal rendering, but is this the man?++++@++++Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!
Hey, hey. What's going on here?++++@++++Well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed...
Ready, Mr. Simpson?++++@++++Yes, sir.
So, Simpson. Which one is it?++++@++++Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty.
No, no! Which one is the robber?++++@++++Oh, definitely number... Heh heh...
Hmmm, very... thorough.++++@++++I'm home everybody.
You missed the whole slide show, Homer.++++@++++Oh fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when... Oooh oooh, ooh, the news.
The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.++++@++++Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?++++@++++He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
And just in... actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.++++@++++The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome."
I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.++++@++++Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.
-- with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers -- Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986.++++@++++Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.
Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats?++++@++++Yes, sir.
Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today?++++@++++Yes, I do.
Fine, would you point him out to us?++++@++++Okay.
But Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality.++++@++++No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with the winning team.
It better not, you dimwit.++++@++++Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.
Now just a darn...++++@++++Ahhhh!
Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?++++@++++Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.
Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you're outta here.++++@++++Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.
Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?++++@++++You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.++++@++++What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
You're no more of a pig than I am.++++@++++Oh, no.
See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.++++@++++Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.
I'm not done. After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift.++++@++++I read you loud and clear.
What kind of flowers?++++@++++Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that.
Well, we have some beautiful long stemmed roses. They're fifty-five dollars a dozen.++++@++++One, please.
Oliver Klozoff! Call for Oliver Klozoff.++++@++++...and I've made reservations at the Chez Paree.
But, Homer, it's so expensive.++++@++++It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Off Ramp Inn.
Oh, oh, Homer. I feel giddy. Wait, what about a babysitter?++++@++++Oops.
Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service.++++@++++Hello, this is Mr... Sampson.
Did your wife just call a second ago?++++@++++No. I said Sampson, not Simpson.
Like an angel.++++@++++BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!
Work that body, Homer.++++@++++You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man.
Not if I can help it.++++@++++Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.
You don't have a clue, do you, Dad?++++@++++Out, boy, out.
What a grump.++++@++++Smooth as a baby's behind.
Precious? I think I hear the doorbell.++++@++++I think you're right, dumplin'.
Yes. I am Ms. Botz.++++@++++Well, don't just stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.
Oh, the Elves, the Elves!++++@++++Bye kids. Watch out for the boy.
Why don't you pick one that's a little more frisky, sir?++++@++++Why?
Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster.++++@++++Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes.
Excellent choice, sir. May I lead you to your table?++++@++++Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later.
Homer, you look just like a little boy.++++@++++Because I'm so carefree?
No. Because you're wearing a bib.++++@++++More champagne?
One eight hundred you snitch, no, you... squeal...++++@++++Don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.
Oh, there it... went.++++@++++No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit.
Okay, but watch out. Don't slam my head like last time.++++@++++Sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it.
Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.++++@++++Ooh, your blue thing with the things?
You'll see.++++@++++Well, shake a leg, Mama.
Homer, wake up. There's no answer at home.++++@++++So?
So, I'm worried. I think we should go home.++++@++++All right. I suppose my work here is done.
How come all the lights are on?++++@++++I don't like the looks of this.
I can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.++++@++++Oh, these things are heavy.
Mr. Sampson, can I give you a bit of advice?++++@++++Sure.
Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.++++@++++Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --
This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den.++++@++++Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --
Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Babysitter Bandit?++++@++++The what?
The Babysitter Bandit.++++@++++Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.
Awww, Homer.++++@++++Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.
Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right.++++@++++Yeah. Yeah!
Soup's on! Hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top.++++@++++Eww, I hate that icky soup skin.
He doesn't care, Mom.++++@++++Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...
Well, okay. I got an A on my vocabulary test.++++@++++What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper.
What's the big idea? You covered up my paper.++++@++++Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.
Ah well, maybe just one more hour.++++@++++It's so unfair... just because he's different.
Well, time to hit the books.++++@++++Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em.
All right, okay, let's take care of some business. "Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom. On September fifteenth, sixteen-twenty, Puritan separatists from the Church of England, some living in Holland, left Plymouth, England. Their destination was --++++@++++Psst... Marge. Come take a look at this.
Oh! The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing?++++@++++Just a little dim, I guess.
Hey Milhouse, what did I miss in school today?++++@++++I have hair!... I have hair!
Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.++++@++++Hey, Dr. J.
I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result, Bart is an underachiever. And yet he seems to be... how should I put this...? Proud of it?++++@++++Hmmm...
Blah, blah, blah... blah, blah, blah, blah.++++@++++Hmmm huh.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah ...++++@++++Hmmmm
No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.++++@++++And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.
Hm, hey, Martin.++++@++++I have hair! Look! Look!
Oh now, don't forget the nuclear power plant, Bill. That's closed too.++++@++++Whoo hoo! All right!
Please please please please please please please. All right!++++@++++Yeah!
So...++++@++++Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen.
Okay, the capital of North Dakota is named after what German ruler?++++@++++Hitler.
Hitler?++++@++++Hey, I'm still beating you, boy.
Green.++++@++++I was right.
I used to think that losing my hair was as inevitable as the tides. Then I found out about Dimoxinil, the new miracle breakthrough in hair regrowth.++++@++++Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?
For your free brochure, send five dollars to: Dimoxinil, 485 Hair Plaza, Hair City, Utah.++++@++++Hair... hair... Just like everybody else.
You know, some women find bald men quite virile.++++@++++Marge, weren't you listening? This is a miracle breakthrough. Not one of these cheapo sucker deals.
Allow me to present the Dimoxinil Action Set in its entirety. A six month supply of the drug, the gravity boots, scalp massager and your tee shirt.++++@++++Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?
One thousand dollars.++++@++++A thousand bucks. I can't afford that.
Hmmm. Well, we do have a product which is more in your price range. However, I must assure you that any hair growth you experience while using it will be purely coincidental.++++@++++A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!
Ah ha, that's telling him, Homer.++++@++++Out of tartar sauce.
Quit complaining, chrome-dome.++++@++++If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that.
Homer, don't be a sap all of your life. Just fill out a few medical insurance forms creatively. Charge that Dimoxinil stuff to the company.++++@++++But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.
Yeah! Besides you pay money into the insurance fund every week. What do you ever get out of it?++++@++++Nothing... well, that newsletter.
Exactly! Why should you get nothing while some guy who loses a finger hits the jackpot?++++@++++You got me!
Homer Simpson! Why, why, why, you haven't been here I-in twenty years! Hey, you got rid of the sideburns.++++@++++Gimme the usual.
I don't want to think about it.++++@++++Daddy's home, Sugar!
Homie, my sisters are here.++++@++++Ah, dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven.
Attention Homer Simpson. You have been promoted. You are now an executive. Take three minutes to say goodbye to your former friends and report to room 503 for reassignment to a better life.++++@++++Well, your resume seems in order. Besides typing and stuff, do you have any other qualifications I should know about?
I give great back rubs to harried executives. Here. Let me show you.++++@++++No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye.
Hello, Homie. How's my big important executive?++++@++++Oh Marge, every woman I iÂ­nÂ­tÂ­eÂ­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me.
He sounds good. Hire him.++++@++++I'll call you back, Marge.
Simpson! MÂ­eÂ­eting in the board room tomorrow at two. Just sit there and keep your mouth shut. Got it?++++@++++Yes, Mr. Smithers.
You don't belong here.++++@++++Huh?
You don't belong here. You're a fraud and a phony and it's only a matter of time until they find you out.++++@++++Who told you?
You did! You told me with the way you slump your shoulders, the-the way you talk into your chest, the way you smother yourself in bargain basement lime-green polyester. I want you to say to yourself: I deserve this! I love it! I am nature's greatest miracle! Go ahead, say it.++++@++++I... I de...
Trust me, Homer.++++@++++I de...
Take a step and say it.++++@++++I deserve this.
SHOUT IT!++++@++++I AM NATURE'S GREATEST MIRACLE!
I'll need three weeks vacation and moving expenses.++++@++++YOU GOT IT, BUDDY!
A man's suit should make him feel like a prince. It should cry out to the world, "Here I am! Don't judge me! Love me!"++++@++++Do any of these suits do that?
Mom and Dad have been smooching again.++++@++++Gotta run, Marge. Can't be late.
Happy anniversary, Homer.++++@++++What? Our anniversary? Are you sure?
Can't you see!++++@++++Hello?
You then! How would you improve the worker situation?++++@++++Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.
Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?++++@++++Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.
I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!++++@++++Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.
Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!++++@++++Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.
Mr. Simpson, don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer! They've given you the key!++++@++++The key!
Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway.++++@++++Can do, sir.
Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?++++@++++Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?
An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.++++@++++Yea... eh... how about a pony?
I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know.++++@++++Uh, well okay, what the hey?
Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired.++++@++++What?
Wait! Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this.++++@++++You did?
My reasons are my own.++++@++++Karl, you saved me. Why?
Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.++++@++++Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.
Just walk me to my car.++++@++++Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?++++@++++No.
Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --++++@++++I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?
Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir.++++@++++Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.++++@++++Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!
I guess I haven't taught you anything.++++@++++What do you mean?
Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can.++++@++++No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.
Oh no, you're not.++++@++++How do you know?
Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.++++@++++Karl.
He is Homer Simpson, sir.++++@++++A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to.++++@++++Uh, why?
Simpson, how old do you think I am?++++@++++I don't know... a hundred and two?
Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back.++++@++++What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.
Now get out of here before I reconsider.++++@++++Oh, better hurry up.
Homer, are you still awake?++++@++++I've never been more awake in my life.
Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it.++++@++++And... and?! What about loving me?
Oh, Homer, honey. Come here.++++@++++What?!
Come here. "YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /++++@++++I'M EVERYTHING YOU NEED /
That's all of it. Sign here.++++@++++There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself.
A buck! I'm glad there's a curse on this place.++++@++++Huh? Well... it's all ours!
I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.++++@++++Motivated seller, Marge.
Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this.++++@++++So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
What on earth was that?++++@++++Probably just the house settling.
Homer! What's this thing in the corner?++++@++++I don't know.
It looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.++++@++++Ooh, a vortex.
Get... Out!!!++++@++++Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.
Evil!++++@++++Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.
Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now.++++@++++Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...
I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.++++@++++Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
All right. But if anything happens...++++@++++What could happen?
That does it. Children, get dressed. We're leaving.++++@++++Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it.
Man, this place has got everything!++++@++++An ancient Indian what...?
Let's go, children.++++@++++Aw, gee, Marge.
Look at me. I've never been so angry. My hands are shaking.++++@++++Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!
Hmmm. Life with the Simpsons. What choice do I have.++++@++++Wow!
Homer, all these flies.++++@++++Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh.
Cool man!++++@++++The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.
Dinnertime.++++@++++Hey! Get a load of that spread.
Sloppy Joes!++++@++++Smothered pork chops.
There's something not quite right about this.++++@++++The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.
Your wife is quite a... dish.++++@++++Oooh, thanks.
Get with the times, man.++++@++++Marge and I played that old game before we were married.
Oh, we wouldn't want to spoil our appetite for... the great feast when we land on Rigel Four.++++@++++Oooh, a feast.
Oh, you'll be at the feast. I have a feeling you'll be the guests of honor.++++@++++Tell us more about this feast.
If you don't believe me, look at this book I found.++++@++++Marge, she's right.
Humans, you have stopped eating.++++@++++Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons.
I beg your pardon.++++@++++Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
Way to go, Lis.++++@++++Yeah, thanks Lisa.
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,++++@++++Huh?
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.++++@++++'Tis some visitor,
-- sorrow for the lost Lenore --++++@++++Oh, Lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore.++++@++++Aag!
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.++++@++++Surely --
I said --++++@++++-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some unseen censer,++++@++++Ouch! Censer..
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.++++@++++Wretch --
I cried --++++@++++-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
Nevermore.++++@++++Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!
I shrieked of starting,++++@++++Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
Homer, I am not sleeping with the lights on. They're just children's stories. They can't hurt you.++++@++++Oh... oh, I hate Halloween.
Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.++++@++++Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
You're late for work, Homer.++++@++++So... Someone will punch in for me.
Keep those mutants comin', Homer.++++@++++I'll mutant you.
Yeah. Well that's always been like that.++++@++++Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.
Empty! Bah!!++++@++++Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Working late, Simpson?++++@++++Uh... uh yes, sir.
You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in.++++@++++Ooooh, cushy.
They say we're contaminating the planet.++++@++++Well, nobody's perfect.
Why can't the government just get off our backs?++++@++++You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.
Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.++++@++++I bet you could afford it, though.
To create a new and better world.++++@++++If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.++++@++++Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.++++@++++Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
Is your boss Governor yet?++++@++++Not yet, son. Not yet.
Absolutely not!++++@++++Come on, Marge.
Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.++++@++++Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.
Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.++++@++++Marge! Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.
No, I'm just fine right here.++++@++++What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
Well, I don't feel like snuggling.++++@++++What's that got to do with it?
I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.++++@++++But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.
Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight.++++@++++Huh?
Well, what do we think?++++@++++Hey! Hello, handsome!
Hello, Homer. Marge, you look dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel.++++@++++Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns.
Aaaah... kitty, kitty.++++@++++Are you all right, Mr. Burns?
He's smokin'. He's smokin'.++++@++++"You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"
Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.++++@++++I was only reading what the card...
Homer... Homer... make them stop.++++@++++Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...
Uh oh. You're busted, Dad.++++@++++Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?
Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.++++@++++Hey, you did it!
So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?++++@++++Aw, Barney.
Come on, Homer. We're dyin' of curiosity.++++@++++Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.
C'mom, Homer.++++@++++Well, okay. It all started on "Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night," down at Springfield stadium.
Hey, get on the bus, dancin' Homer.++++@++++You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.
What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?++++@++++Sure, we get a nice mix here.
I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy.++++@++++Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.
I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer.++++@++++What are you getting at?
Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.++++@++++Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.
Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps.++++@++++Uh... Simp-sons, sir.
Lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway...++++@++++What's the matter, boy?
"Hmmm, Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26... How 'bout it? -- Flash."++++@++++Wow! Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge.
Hey, Dad, look, you're on JumboVision!++++@++++Whoa!
Homer... Homer... X.Y.Z.++++@++++Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!
Oh, shut up.++++@++++Hey, Burns! Hey, "Rag Arm"!
Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them.++++@++++Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!
Here we are, sir.++++@++++Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...
All this means is you can't wave your fanny in public.++++@++++Rub it in.
here! Duff Beer! that, Marge?++++@++++Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.
I suppose you want a beer?++++@++++Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.
Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat.++++@++++Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
THE HITTER'S OFF HIS ROCKER / KISSING BETTY CROCKER!++++@++++Good one, sir.
Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.++++@++++LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!
Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?++++@++++Don't mind if I do.
Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?++++@++++All right, Burnsie.
Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the post-game show.++++@++++C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.++++@++++What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!
Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?++++@++++M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?++++@++++Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.
A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.++++@++++Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
Hey, knock that off or I'll stick this bat where the sun don't shine.++++@++++Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.
Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever...++++@++++Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.
Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City.++++@++++Me? In the majors?
Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you.++++@++++I'll say!
Why don't you talk it over with your family?++++@++++Because they might say no.
I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.++++@++++It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?++++@++++Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts.++++@++++You mean -- ?
Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.++++@++++It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?++++@++++That's right, Ned.
Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well...++++@++++Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not.
IN CAPITAL CITY..."++++@++++Kids, look! Street crime!
A BUM / FEEL LIKE A KING..."++++@++++Wow! That's service!
...FOURTH STREET AND D!/ YEAH!/ ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF IT...YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO ROAM.++++@++++The Duff Brewery!
Awww. Come to bed, Homie.++++@++++Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.
See you after the game, when you're a big star.++++@++++Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper on the front of this thing, if you know what I mean.++++@++++Right, Mr. Goofball.
Hey, call me plain ol' "Goof". So what exactly do you have planned for us?++++@++++Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.
Throw at his head!++++@++++Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Red hots! Get your read hots here!++++@++++Oooh, red hots.
Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's newest sensation, Dancin' Homer!++++@++++Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. Uh oh.
There he is!++++@++++I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.
These cornball antics may play in the sticks, but this is Capital City!++++@++++The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.++++@++++What a family.
What a saga.++++@++++Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.
Tell it again, Homer.++++@++++Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
Hey there, neighbor! The Lord's certainly given us a beautiful day today. Huh?++++@++++H'lo, Flanders.
Doing a little yard work, huh?++++@++++Who told? Marge! Beer me!
Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif.++++@++++Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
Well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there.++++@++++There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.
Well, you may be right!++++@++++Marge! Where's the Duff?
Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me.++++@++++Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.
Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead.++++@++++Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years.
Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?
Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.++++@++++Well, beggars can't be choosy.
Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes.++++@++++All right, knock it off!
Uh, knock what off, Simpson?++++@++++You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.++++@++++I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Play it where it lays, Homer.++++@++++Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...
What exactly did he say?++++@++++Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!
Well, how did he say it?++++@++++Well... he...
Was he angry?++++@++++No.
Was he rude?++++@++++Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!
Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.++++@++++Oh, he's perfect now, is he?
Well, he's not perfect, but he is very...++++@++++No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.
I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now.++++@++++Dear neighbor... 
I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.++++@++++"Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."
I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.++++@++++Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.++++@++++Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy.
Heh, heh, heh heh...++++@++++But I got it in the middle!
Give up, Homeboy. There's a six-stroke limit.++++@++++I know, I know. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze.
Hi, Simpson! Having fun?++++@++++Flanders! What are you doing here?
All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there.++++@++++That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
Good shot, Toddsky!++++@++++Luck.
Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...++++@++++Never mind!
So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?++++@++++Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good.++++@++++Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
But Dad, I've never won anything in my life.++++@++++Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.
You brought food...++++@++++Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.
Mr. Putter.++++@++++Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.
Mom.++++@++++Your putter's name is Charlene!
Who's Charlene?++++@++++I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!
Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.++++@++++And?
Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament.++++@++++But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.
Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?++++@++++Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?++++@++++I said NOW!
I can't believe it... You've actually found a practical use for geometry.++++@++++Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
Hey, Simpson.++++@++++Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.
Well, sir, may the best man win.++++@++++Ah, "may the best man win". The mating call of the loser.
Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance.++++@++++Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?
Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?++++@++++That's right!
All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!++++@++++What, are you afraid to make a real bet?
You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.++++@++++How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.
All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!++++@++++Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.
Eh, eh, just a minute. "Loser" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say "the boy who doesn't win"?++++@++++Oh man. Fine.
Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.++++@++++I'm game if you are, Flanders.
Okay, I'll try.++++@++++Anybody can try! I want you to win!
Oatmeal.++++@++++Oatmeal?
Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.++++@++++News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.
Thanks, man!++++@++++Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.
Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.++++@++++Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.
No, you will.++++@++++'Fraid not.
And the battle is well and truly joined!++++@++++Woo-hoo-hoo!
It's okay, son. You can recover.++++@++++Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: "If you lose, you're out of the family."
Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal.++++@++++Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!
What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.++++@++++I got it right here in writing.
But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too.++++@++++It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?++++@++++Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days.++++@++++Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
Bart, cut it out!++++@++++Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!++++@++++Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!
Uh-oh. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose...++++@++++Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
Who the hell is that?++++@++++Bullwinkle.
Who? Wait a minute, who's that?++++@++++Underdog! Don't you know anything?
Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.++++@++++Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.
Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters.++++@++++I know, I will.
Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?++++@++++See, Maggie? Those silver and blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. Understand?
And now, get set for our fabulous half-time show, featuring the well-groomed young go-getters of "Hurray for Everything!"++++@++++Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!
Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me!++++@++++Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here.
Slow down, boy. What's your hurry?++++@++++This place is depressing.
Hey, I live here!++++@++++Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Let's go.
That's no way to lay a fire! Where's your kindling?++++@++++This thing's gonna be roaring any time now!
Dinner! Dinner time, everybody! Dinner!++++@++++The hell with this.
Lisa! My goodness! That's very impressive!++++@++++Holy moly! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw.
Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...++++@++++Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!
You don't even care! You don't even care!++++@++++All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!
I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...++++@++++...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?
Oh, why don't I go talk to her?++++@++++Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything.
Uh-oh!... I mean, good!++++@++++Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that.
Homer was never stubborn. He always folded instantly over anything. It was as if he had no will of his own. Isn't that true, Homer?++++@++++Yes, Dad.
Pompous, blow-dried, college boy!++++@++++You know, his girlfriend is the weather lady.
It's Bart!++++@++++What show is this?
Oh, no! My sweet little Bart!++++@++++Hello, operator? Gimme the number for 911!
Can you think of any reason he might have run away? Anything at all?++++@++++Well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister.
Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves.++++@++++We can, and will!
Children need discipline. You can ask any syndicated advice columnist.++++@++++Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?
Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried!++++@++++Oh it's great to have you back, boy! We were afraid we'd lost you!
No, no, no! That won't do at all!++++@++++Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness.
Now we can blame him for everything.++++@++++It's your fault I'm bald!
But I only got up to go to the can.++++@++++Damn, no spots.
Apology accepted.++++@++++You know Marge, we're great parents!
Correction, was your seat.++++@++++Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool.
Twenty tons and four stories of car-crunching, fire-breathing prehistoric insanity.++++@++++Whoa.
Aren't you forgetting something?++++@++++Uh... Monster Truck Rally, growth thing... No, I don't think so.
But Truckasaurous is one night only!++++@++++Oh, cruel fate. Why do you mock me?
Now, come on, you two. What time does your little truck game start?++++@++++Eight o'clock, but what does it matter?
Well, Lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. We could go to both.++++@++++Marge, you're a genius.
People let's have good assembly manners. People, people. Quiet down, now, please. Don't make me flick the lights on and off. Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen, parents and music lovers. Welcome to the first in a series of Saturday evening concerts.++++@++++Series?!
Tonight Sherbert's... ... uh, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.++++@++++Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long.
Remember, children, stay together. Five, six, seven, eight...++++@++++That was beautiful. Can we go now?
Sit down, Homer.++++@++++How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?
Oh my, Lisa was wonderful. She certainly's come a long way with her fingering.++++@++++Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all.
My son... my son.++++@++++Come on, Flanders, he's not that bad.
Homer, drive defensively.++++@++++Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
Truckasaurous!++++@++++Where, where?
Gimme some nachos, Homersaurous.++++@++++Here you go, Bartasaurous.
This is so cool.++++@++++Oh I can't watch.
Dad, I want to be a daredevil.++++@++++Kids say such stupid things.
Oh, my little boy, .++++@++++Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im.
Better than all right, I got stitches.++++@++++Ewwww.
Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment.++++@++++Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?
Thank you. How 'bout a hand for these brave little animals?++++@++++Oh, hi, kids. Thanks.
What's the matter?++++@++++You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.
You can't.++++@++++I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge.++++@++++He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.
Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him.++++@++++Oh, that never works. He's a goner.
Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try.++++@++++Okay, okay. I'll try.
Ah, nothing.++++@++++You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?
Aw, come on.++++@++++I mean it, boy.
Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge.++++@++++That's my boy.
How'd it go, Homer?++++@++++You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there.
Hey, what gives?++++@++++Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.
But, Dad, you'll never make it.++++@++++Don't you think I know that?
Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.++++@++++Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.
A dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...++++@++++You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.
A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric... and a whisper of MSG.++++@++++Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice rack!
You don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.++++@++++It's no trouble. I've got a whole garageful of tools I never use.
Hey, down in front!++++@++++Shut up, boy.
Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?++++@++++No, I can't. It's broken.
No, Maggie! Bad baby!++++@++++Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again.
Because.++++@++++Because why?
Because I said so.++++@++++Because you said so, why?
Homer! I'm trying to work!++++@++++Oh. What are you doing?
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?++++@++++Heh, heh, heh.
This is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?++++@++++Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
Well, that's what we want them to do, Homer.++++@++++Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?
Hmmm, sure. Oh, dear. I can't. I've got three protest rallies tomorrow.++++@++++Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
Don't do that! Don't do that! Hey! Don't DO that!++++@++++Take that you dumb squirrel.
Mmmmmmmph!++++@++++Where do they get their ideas?
It's an asphalt spreader! It's sixty- seven tools in one! How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?++++@++++One thousand dollars.
Don't answer yet...++++@++++Oh, sorry.
... because you also get...++++@++++I was watching that.
I think it sucks.++++@++++... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.
So what did you kids do today?++++@++++Sit down, boy!
I didn't really expect things to change this much.++++@++++Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better.
"Smartline!" With our local Emmy-award winning host, Kent Brockman.++++@++++Really? Great!
David.++++@++++Oh. What's wrong, Marge?
Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.++++@++++Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.
Really, why?++++@++++They're forcing 'em.
Yessir!++++@++++He's awake!
I did go away, Mom! I was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of Hell. And you were there! And you! And you! And you! You I've never seen before.++++@++++Hey, yeah! Who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance...
It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.++++@++++Ooo, classy.
That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.++++@++++Wow...
Hey, Simpson, I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy.++++@++++Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and...
Mr. Burns wants you to march into his office right now.++++@++++Uh-oh...
Ah, Simpson! At last we meet.++++@++++Nice to meet you too, sir.
... One... Hundred... Dollars! Of course you'll have to sign a waiver, relinquishing your right to sue and so forth... merely a formality...++++@++++A hundred bucks?
Throw him out, Smithers.++++@++++You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out.
Oh... oh well. Mr. Simpson, the State Bar forbids me from promising you a big cash settlement. But, just between you and me, I promise you, a big cash settlement. My fee is fifty percent.++++@++++Fifty percent?
You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift to you.++++@++++Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
A million dollars.++++@++++Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!
You see that dark spot there? Whiplash.++++@++++Whiplash! Oh no!
Am I gonna die?++++@++++Yes, son.
Will I ever play baseball again?++++@++++No!
That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine.++++@++++Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?
Thank you, your honor. Now, Bart, I want you to tell the jury, in your own words, exactly what happened on the day of the accident.++++@++++Just give me a ticket.
Dad, may I please make an observation?++++@++++Oh, what? What is it?
Oh, I don't like everything about them, just their heads. Well, would you care for some wine, old buddy?++++@++++Don't mind if I do.
Bottoms up Simpson, there's plenty more where that came from.++++@++++Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?
Yes. Now then, Homer, old chum, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What do you say, we settle this man to man?++++@++++You mean duke it out?
Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all.++++@++++Five hundred thousand dollars!
Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose.++++@++++Well, Marge, what do you think?
Oh, I feel faint..++++@++++Five hundred thousand dollars. I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.++++@++++Oh, the truth!
I'm sorry, but my mother always said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."++++@++++Will that hold up in court?
But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson.++++@++++Oh, Marge.
Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?++++@++++Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you.
Some string beans?++++@++++No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you.
Some celery with cream cheese on it?++++@++++No, thank you.
What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong.++++@++++Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?
Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't.++++@++++Moe, I wish he'd shut up.
And it's not even Ladies Night.++++@++++Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.
Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.++++@++++Oh, Marge...
We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--++++@++++No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.
What are you saying, Homer?++++@++++I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore.
Homer, look at me.++++@++++Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.
McBain!!++++@++++Sorry to scare you like that, babe.
Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.++++@++++Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!
Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!++++@++++Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.
Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.++++@++++What are you getting at?
Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the...++++@++++What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner.++++@++++Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.
Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere...++++@++++Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?
Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken.++++@++++Fine. We'll go to Mars.
Please, Homer. Can't we try it?++++@++++No!
Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both.++++@++++If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?
Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time.++++@++++Oh, try me.
Please, Dad.++++@++++No.
Please, Dad...please++++@++++Oh, okay, okay!
Please, do not be alarmed. Our chefs are just saying hello.++++@++++Oh, okay. HELLO!
Not today. And sir?++++@++++It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those.
No, no, no. Toshiro, the squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame.++++@++++Good thing I'm open-minded.
And I'd like to dedi-cate this next song to my wife, Patti. "I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELLING SHOW / MAMA USED TO DANCE FOR THE MONEY THEY'D THROW / PAPA WOULD DO WHATEVER HE COULD..."++++@++++... oh, oh, and two of these things.
Two uni.++++@++++And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...
I recommend it with a raw quail egg on top.++++@++++You're the doctor!
Right on.++++@++++There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
It is blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one...++++@++++Come on, pal! Fugu me!
Concentrate. Concentrate...++++@++++I want fugu!
For God's sake, don't eat another bite!++++@++++Oh, I couldn't possibly.
Mr. Simpson-san. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you have eaten poison.++++@++++Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
Hmmm, your wife agreed that I should break this to you.++++@++++No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.
No, Mr. Simpson. If in fact, you've consumed the venom of the blowfish -- and from what the chef has told me, it's quite probable, you have twenty-four hours to live.++++@++++Twenty-four hours?
Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.++++@++++Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through five stages. The first is denial.++++@++++No way! Because I'm not dying.
The second is anger.++++@++++Why you little --
And after that comes fear.++++@++++What's after fear? What's after fear?
Bargaining.++++@++++Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.
Finally, acceptance.++++@++++Well, we all gotta go some time.
Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me. I-I should leave you two alone. Perhaps this pamphlet will be helpful.++++@++++So you're going to die... 
I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?++++@++++Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?++++@++++Almost.
When we're intimate?++++@++++Be intimate with Marge.
Can I just make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?++++@++++Ah, watch the sunrise.
You looked so peaceful lying there.++++@++++There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.
Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?++++@++++Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, "cover for me." Number two, "oh, good idea, boss." Number three, "it was like that when I got here."
Hey, this is good stuff.++++@++++...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.
It was like that when I got here.++++@++++Oh, that's my boy.
Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy.++++@++++Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it?
No-sirree-Bob!++++@++++Hey, Flanders, could I borrow your camcorder?
Okey-dokel. Hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?++++@++++No, thanks.
Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard.++++@++++No, I don't want-a...
Oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'.++++@++++Flanders, I said I didn't -- Tomorrow? Sure, what the hey. I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen.
I beg your pardon?++++@++++This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Oooooooh. Hope that didn't scare you. Well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... He was a simple man. A kind man. A gentle man who loved his children and...
Huh? Oh, it's you. What do you want?++++@++++Dad, we've never been too close, have we?
Not to my knowledge.++++@++++Never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other.
We never danced the Hoochy-Koo, either. What's your point?++++@++++I just want you to know that I love you, Dad.
Oh, son, I love you, too. Hey, how about a hug?++++@++++Dad!
Sonny boy!++++@++++Papa!
Junior!++++@++++My old man. Well, I gotta go.
Oh, son, no. We've got a lotta catchin' up to do. What do you say... we go fishin'?++++@++++Well, gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such a tight schedule--
I love you, son!++++@++++Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved.
Whoa! Well, that sounded like an order.++++@++++I pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when I say "give me a ticket", just give me a ticket.
Okay, Flash. You get one phone call.++++@++++Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.
What? I'm home. I'm home. Hi, Homer.++++@++++You gotta help me, Barney. I'm in jail.
Hiya, neighbor. I can see you.++++@++++Ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.
You're dyin' and you weren't even gonna stop at Moe's for a last beer with your buddies?++++@++++Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!
Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.++++@++++Hey, Burns! Eat my shorts!
Oh, wait a minute. Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew.++++@++++Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please.
Please, not in public.++++@++++I love you, Barney.
Oh, how European.++++@++++Come on, Barney, I gotta get home.
I'm twirling as fast as I can.++++@++++Oh, I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm comin' home, baby.
Oh, where can he be?++++@++++Marge! Marge!
I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called, "To A Husband."++++@++++Okay, okay.
Ahem. "The blackened clouds are forming ..."++++@++++Oh, gimme a break, Marge.
"... Soon the rain will fall / My dear one is departing/ But first please heed this call / That always will I love you / My one, my love, my all."++++@++++That was beautiful.
His drool! It's warm! He's alive! Homer, Homer, wake up, you're alive!++++@++++All right. Stop it! Cut it out!
Wake up! You're alive! You're alive!++++@++++What are you talking about?
You're alive!++++@++++I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!
Oh, it will not.++++@++++Oh yes it will.
My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...++++@++++I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
Dad, do something!++++@++++All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.
Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.++++@++++Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?
Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out.++++@++++Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.
I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!++++@++++She's right! She's right!
You lie!++++@++++Bart!
Hey, Homer. You're late for English.++++@++++English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke.
Oh, no! We're late for wood shop.++++@++++But we're early for lunch. Let's go grab a burger.
Boy, you never stop eatin' and you don't gain a pound.++++@++++Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones.
Oooh, shot down again.++++@++++Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom.
Hey, who's that?++++@++++I... I don't know!
Hey, would you like to go to the...++++@++++She's mine!
I'm a political prisoner. Last time I ever take a stand.++++@++++Well, I'm here for being me. Every day I show up, act like me, and they slap me in here.
Simpson! Be quiet!++++@++++I haven't seen you in school before.
Okay, Simpson.++++@++++What?
I'm sorry, I don't even know your name.++++@++++I'm Homer.
Three days!++++@++++J.
Four days!++++@++++Simpson.
Five days!++++@++++It was worth it.
It was a jailhouse romance, man.++++@++++I'd reached step one: She knew I existed. The only problem was, she didn't care.
What's the matter, boy?++++@++++Nothing.
You haven't said boo all night, and usually I have to wrestle the bucket out of your greasy mitts.++++@++++Dad, I'm in love.
Uh-oh. Why don't you grab yourself a beer, boy.++++@++++But, Dad, I don't drink...
Now, this girlfriend of yours. Is she a real looker?++++@++++Uh-huh.
A lot on the ball?++++@++++Oh, yeah.
Ohhh, son, don't overreach. Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl. Ohh, I blame myself. I should have had this talk a long time ago.++++@++++Thanks, Pop.
Good Lord! Simpson, you should have come to see me a long time ago.++++@++++Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me.
That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.++++@++++Oh.
Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend.++++@++++Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?
Oh, I believe she's very active on the Forensics Team. They meet in the new building. Room two-nineteen.++++@++++Far out!
Homer, do you have any plans for after graduation?++++@++++Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
Well thank you, Artie.++++@++++My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.
Well, we have an opening on the Debate Team.++++@++++Debate? Like, arguing?
This year's topic is, "Resolved: The national speed limit should be lowered to fifty-five miles per hour."++++@++++Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!
Our current speed limit is an anachronism. The fatuity...++++@++++Ignoramus.
Will you shut up?++++@++++Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
Ignoramus?++++@++++Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?
There's a difference between ignorance and stupidity.++++@++++Not to me there isn't!
Homer,++++@++++You ignoramus.
You're the ignoramus.++++@++++No, you...
Homer, would you like to present your rebuttal?++++@++++With pleasure.
Yes, I remember.++++@++++So... you wanna go out with me?
Well, I don't think you're my type.++++@++++Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel.
Hmm, I don't know.++++@++++Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair.
Well put.++++@++++Well, what's the good word?
I'm sorry.++++@++++What?
Well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but I really don't have the time.++++@++++What?
And the City Forensics championship is coming up.++++@++++Yeah, so....
Oh, and I-I tutor part time.++++@++++You tutor?
Just those who need help with French.++++@++++French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.
Great story. Positively spellbinding. Work, damn you, work!++++@++++Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks.
Why is there make-out music on?++++@++++It helps me study. Heh-heh-heh.
Well, not me. Shut it off and let's get down to business.++++@++++Cray-on.
Bien.++++@++++Fenetre.
Tres bien. Well, I should probably be going. I have a big Forensics meet tomorrow.++++@++++Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?
Homer, you're amazing. Before you couldn't say bon jour. But now you can conjugate all the regular verbs, two irregular verbs, and sing the first verse of "Allouette".++++@++++ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...
Yes. Thousands of them.++++@++++I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --
Consonants.++++@++++-- Consonants, with your beautiful mouth, and your beautiful breath pushing them past your beautiful teeth...
Merci, I guess.++++@++++Marge, would you go to the prom with me?
You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension.++++@++++I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui.
Oui.++++@++++Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw.
Maybe I'll wear my hair... up.++++@++++Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better.
You knew the City Forensics finals are tomorrow. And you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. Homer J. Simpson, I hate you!++++@++++Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?
Who or what are you?++++@++++I'm her date.
Mm-hmm. I suppose you want to come in and sit down.++++@++++Oh, okay.
You know, I usually insist on approving Marge's dates, but from what she's told me I'm sure you're a solid citizen.++++@++++Thanks, Mr. B.
I also said I hated you and we haven't even talked since then.++++@++++I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope.
Hey, buddy, where's your date?++++@++++She's with him.
Ouch! So, I guess you want me to take you home?++++@++++Hey, I paid for this car. I paid for this tuxedo and I paid for the two dinners. We're going to the prom.
Homer Simpson, I thought you dropped out.++++@++++You wish, Dondelinger.
Steak or chicken?++++@++++One of each, please.
Comin' through.++++@++++Barney!
Children, we have tabulated your votes. The King and Queen of Springfield High School's Class of 1974 are -- Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier!++++@++++Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!
Why do birds suddenly appear? Every time you're near!++++@++++I gotta get outta here.
Wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?++++@++++Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?
Well, where to now, Romeo?++++@++++Inspiration Point.
Well, it's one o'clock. If you want to keep me, I'm afraid it's gonna be forty-five dollars an hour.++++@++++Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home.
That is the most dishonest thing I've ever heard.++++@++++Huh?
Hey, you easy. Now, get off my property! Off!++++@++++Hey, Flanders. Who put that bug up your butt?
Ohhh. I wanted to subscribe to that new Arts and Crafts Channel. Well, sir, they send over this flimflam man to install it, and do you know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every cable channel for only fifty bucks.++++@++++Boy, what's this world coming to?
You know, that's exactly what I --++++@++++Gotta go.
What? Oh, hey, if you're having second thoughts, just read this pamphlet.++++@++++So You've Decided To Steal Cable.
Don't you hate it... when you go to the bathroom and... there's no toilet paper?++++@++++It's funny 'cause it's true!
Cable? / Us? / Wow! / We have cable!++++@++++That's right. Sixty-eight channels. MTV for the kids. VH-1 for us. Sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!
Homer, we talked about cable before. Do you really think we can afford it?++++@++++Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that.
Are you sure this is legal?++++@++++Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this.
"Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam." Hmm, well, I don't know.++++@++++Marge --
El Mummeo le pone en el "Sleeper Hold". Donde esta los medicos de Mexico?++++@++++Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport.
Aren't you ready for church, Homer?++++@++++Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.
Now today's Christian doesn't think he needs God. He thinks he's got it made. He's got his hi-fi... his boob tube... and his instant pizza pie...++++@++++Oooh. Pizza.
Hell.++++@++++Bart!
Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?++++@++++The lad has a point.
Dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?++++@++++Read the pamphlet, honey.
Beats the hell out of me.++++@++++Bart!
Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?++++@++++Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?
Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.++++@++++Well, duh.
But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.++++@++++Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?
No, I didn't.++++@++++Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.
Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.++++@++++Well, thank you honey.
Friday night, live from Las Vegas. The ultimate match-up. The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out.++++@++++Whooo!
It's Watson-Tatum II. This time, it's for money!++++@++++Oh, boy!
Only on the Blockbuster Channel.++++@++++How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?
Not too shabby! Whadda you say, Homer?++++@++++We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.
So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.++++@++++Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.
Ooh! Somebody's having a party.++++@++++Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?
Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.++++@++++Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
Aye Carumba!++++@++++Bart!
Blue chips closed up three and three quarters... Oil service stocks slumped slightly on news of OPEC's continuing stalemate at their meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.++++@++++Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.
I promise I will never watch that channel again.++++@++++Good boy.
Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time.++++@++++Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.++++@++++There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.
Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.++++@++++Unhook it?! But I love cable.
Well, then maybe you should pay for it.++++@++++Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.
But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home.++++@++++Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
No, Homer, not over this. No, no.++++@++++It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.
Hey, Simpson!++++@++++Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?
Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks.++++@++++Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor.++++@++++He's not home.
Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly.++++@++++Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
It's a raid!++++@++++Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.++++@++++Oh great.
Thank you, Barney. How many people are coming, Homer?++++@++++Just a select circle of my friends.
Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.++++@++++Oh, didja swipe those from work?
Hey, Homer, I brought ya...++++@++++Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...
Hey, Homer. I brought you a mug.++++@++++Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.
We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.++++@++++Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?
Are you Homer Simpson?++++@++++Yeah.
Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.++++@++++No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...
We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?++++@++++Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.
For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable.++++@++++Oh, no.
Shake hands. Keep it clean.++++@++++Come on, boy.
Dad, we may have saved your soul.++++@++++Yeah, at the worst possible time.
Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!++++@++++The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back.++++@++++Cable clippers, please.
Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...++++@++++Oops.
All I wanted to tell you about WAS this new barbecue joint.++++@++++Ooh! Barbecue!
One. And two. And three. And reach. And five. And six. And seven..++++@++++Marge, honey, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.
See me again tomorrow?++++@++++Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.
Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.++++@++++I'll take that bet.
Patty! Selma! We're home.++++@++++I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.
Marge, I need to speak with you alone.++++@++++Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.
Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?++++@++++Remember? Who could forget?
...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.++++@++++But that was just an idle promise.
I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.++++@++++Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.++++@++++Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.
It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.++++@++++But Marge...
Homer, you will find her a man.++++@++++All right.
And not just any man.++++@++++Okay.
He should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...++++@++++Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?
I am loathe to interrupt your meditation. But the time has come for money to change hands.++++@++++Sorry.
I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.++++@++++But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?
Only to my job.++++@++++But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?
Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?++++@++++Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.
Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace. I'd be delighted!++++@++++Excellent.
I... ah... muh... Be still my foolish heart.++++@++++Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma.
Hey, Baldilocks, I'm Patty.++++@++++Wha...?
Well, don't worry. There are still plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?++++@++++Oh yes, plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait.
Lighten up, Homer. You're making Happy Hour bitterly ironic.++++@++++Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.
I'm intrigued. What does this Selma look like?++++@++++Like my wife's ugly sister.
Homer, my sister is not going out with Barney Gumbel.++++@++++Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know.
Thanks kid. You made my day.++++@++++But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple.
It's time to give away my love like so much cheap wine.++++@++++Take it to the hoop, Selma.
Is too.++++@++++Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.
Da-ad!...++++@++++Not one word.
It's the hospital.++++@++++The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!
Pull your chair closer, my son.++++@++++What is it, Da --
P.U.! Not that close! Ish. Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die someday.++++@++++Oh Dad, you and your imagination.
There's something I think you should know. Homer, you have a half-brother.++++@++++A half-brother?
What are you blubbering about?++++@++++This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me.
Hmmm... Interesting theory.++++@++++I'm going to find my brother. I don't care what it takes. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him!
So, any idea where this bastard lives?++++@++++Bart!
Well his parents aren't married, are they? It's the correct word, isn't it?++++@++++I guess he's got us there.
Ooo, you're a little late, pal. They tore down the orphanage thirty odd years ago.++++@++++Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!
Take it easy, buddy. They moved across the street.++++@++++Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry.
I myself have spent years searching for my long-lost twin brother --++++@++++Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?
Hmmm, according to our records, a Mr. and Mrs. Powell adopted your brother and named him Herbert.++++@++++Herbert. Herbert Powell. Great! Where can I find him?
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to release that information.++++@++++Oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. Please...
Well, I do sympathize with your situation, Mr. Simpson. After all, your brother could be anywhere. Even Detroit.++++@++++I know, he could be anywhere! That's why I want you to narrow it down! Please...
You know Mr. Simpson, if you ask me, the City of Brotherly Love isn't Philadelphia... it's Detroit.++++@++++Well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being I ever...
Read between the lines, you fool.++++@++++Oh, oh... I get it. Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you tell me where my brother lives?
Mr. Simpson, I don't want your --++++@++++Just take it and tell me!
Detroit. He lives in Detroit.++++@++++Fine. Thank you.
Any luck, Homie?++++@++++No, I've called all three Herbert Powells in Detroit. Nothing.
Well, you want to try that H. Powell?++++@++++H! Of course. That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but...
Y'ello.++++@++++Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?
How did you know that?++++@++++Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!
Hey, hey, knock it off! I'm here! I was just silent because of the emotion involved.++++@++++Oh, sorry.
Homer, I think we need to get together.++++@++++Okay, Brother! Grab the next plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out...
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?++++@++++Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further.
Bart! Lisa! If you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home.++++@++++But Marge, I want to see my brother--
Oh for God's sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat.++++@++++Oh.
Did you know you were going... Oh, sorry, sir. I didn't know it was you.++++@++++That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?
Homer! Homer! Welcome to my home, Brother!++++@++++Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
All born in wedlock?++++@++++Yeah, though the boy was a close call.
Oh, I'm afraid I wouldn't know how.++++@++++What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!
God, that new-baby smell. Homer, you're the richest man I know.++++@++++I feel the same about you.
While you're here, I want you to make yourselves right at home. Anytime you're hungry, anytime day or night, Cook will make you anything you want.++++@++++Even pork chops?
Absolutely. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --++++@++++You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?
We don't have a big one.++++@++++Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight... It's Christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach...
Watch me dive! Watch me dive! Watch me dive!++++@++++Okay, we're watching.
Ohh, oh, got him.++++@++++Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!
Okay, Homer. Pick out any one you want.++++@++++Are you sure you want to give me a car?
Hey, you know what these things cost me? There's maybe forty bucks worth of steel in them.++++@++++Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then.
Dook on!++++@++++Why not?
Because Americans don't want big cars.++++@++++Well, then give me one with lots of pep.
Homer, tell the nice man what country you come from.++++@++++America.
Do you hear that, you morons? This is why we're getting killed in the marketplace! Instead of listening to what people want, you're telling 'em what they want. Homer, I need your help.++++@++++You do.
Yeah. I want you to help me design a car. A car for all the Homer Simpsons out there! And I want to pay you two hundred thousand dollars a year!!++++@++++And I want to let you!!
Homer, meet my team of engineers. They're gonna build your car.++++@++++Hi'ya, team.
So, what kind of car would you like, Mr. Simpson?++++@++++I dunno.
The on-board computer.++++@++++All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?
Mr. Simpson, your brother told you to help us with this car now, didn't he?++++@++++Oh yeah, he did!
Hmmm hmmm, then why don't you get us some coffee.++++@++++Oh, okay.
Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!++++@++++Ugh, oh boy.
Hey Homer, how's your car coming?++++@++++Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
You didn't ask for rack and pinion steering, did you?++++@++++Uh, yeah, I think I did.
How could you ask for it? You don't even know what it is! You just called it rack and peanut steering.++++@++++Uh, may I be excused, please?
No! Homer, do you know why I gave you this job?++++@++++Because you think I'm a genius?
Nah, I don't think you're a genius.++++@++++Because you think I'm dynamic?
I don't think you're dynamic.++++@++++You think I work well with others?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Homer, I gave you this job because you're an average schmoo.++++@++++Oh, great.
All you need is a little self-confidence.++++@++++Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars.
Up...up...up. Listen to me, here's what you do. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself, "If I was ever sure of anything, I'm sure of this." Do you understand?++++@++++Sort of.
Answer me again with self-confidence.++++@++++Sort of!
Now go get 'em.++++@++++All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
Sir, the car has a beverage holder.++++@++++Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!
Extremely large beverage holder.++++@++++And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
Little... ball.++++@++++And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
Maybe a built-in video game would keep them entertained?++++@++++You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
What about a separate sound proof bubble dome for the kids? With optional restraints and nuzzles.++++@++++Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!
Now this is spoiling them.++++@++++No! No! No! No! No!
Ladies and gentlemen... esteemed stockholders... members of the press... your Holiness. Tonight, we are going to witness automotive history.++++@++++All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.
Homer gets...++++@++++Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.
Bye, Herb.++++@++++Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.
Maybe I would have been better off?! Maybe? Why, you spongehead, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.++++@++++Ooo.
I'm here! Now where's that millionaire chip-off-the-old-block I call Sonny-Boy?++++@++++Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home.
I thought your car was really cool.++++@++++Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that.
Ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. I think you have the mumps. I'm calling Doctor Hibbert.++++@++++Marge, the dog is hungry!
Well, then, feed him!++++@++++Yes, Master.
Simpson? This is Sylvia Winfield. That canine of yours is in my pool again. I'm calling the dog warden right now!++++@++++Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.
There's only one family on this block... no, on earth... inconsiderate enough to let a monster like that roam free.++++@++++Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --
Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster.++++@++++Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!
Mr. Universe, I wish!++++@++++Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... Assassins!
Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates.++++@++++Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?
Well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. But sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself.++++@++++Yeah.
Sure they are.++++@++++Assassins!
Sometimes you gotta spoil yourself... spoil yourself... spoil yourself.++++@++++But I can't afford to...
Simpson, I order you to buy those shoes!++++@++++Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh.
Whoa! Assassins!++++@++++Yep! Hee, hee. Read 'em and weep.
A hundred and twenty-five dollars!!++++@++++Bart!
I thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.++++@++++Well, you bought all those smoke alarms and we haven't had a single fire.
Hey, wait a minute. What happened here?++++@++++Well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth.
Aloha.++++@++++Well, aloha!
Would you like a free sample?++++@++++The price is right.
If you'd like to buy some, they're only a dollar each.++++@++++Oh, so that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win.
MY QUILT! Six generations, gone.++++@++++Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...
We never had a family meeting before.++++@++++We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
Homer, what are you saying?++++@++++I'm saying...
No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!++++@++++Bart!
No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.++++@++++You do? Ha ha, ha ha ha!
All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?++++@++++No.
Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?++++@++++Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.
Homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?++++@++++No, we have to commit ourselves. Now take this down. "Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says 'I love you' on command."
Oh, he'd be very happy at my farm. You know, people think only mules can pull carts. Impatient people think that, but patient people know better.++++@++++Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow.
Huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab.++++@++++Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital.
Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday.++++@++++My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?
Well, I think we better set an example.++++@++++Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?
To the pony rides.++++@++++No.
Bo-ring.++++@++++He can't ride ponies.
Well, I always enjoy the glass blower at Old Springfield Towne.++++@++++Oh, we saw that.
The Museum of Barnyard Oddities.++++@++++No, Bart. No!
That's gross.++++@++++I got it. The Springfield Mystery Spot.
Go away.++++@++++Oh, come on, Dad, I promise we'll have more fun this time. We're gonna see lions.
I can't go. It's my girlfriend Bea's birthday.++++@++++Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh.
No, she's not invisible, you idiot. See, it's her birthday tonight.++++@++++Yeah, right.
It seems that most of the animals are sleeping.++++@++++Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!
I can tell she really cared for me. She didn't make me a pall bearer.++++@++++I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.
Is someone talking to me? I didn't hear anything.++++@++++Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.
Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, old timer, I do wills. Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks just like a cigar! Isn't that something!++++@++++Yell-o.
Hello, Homer?++++@++++Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.
Grampa!++++@++++Huh?
Is there room at your table for a foolish old man?++++@++++Well... sure. We'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. Bart!
...couldn't buy me the pleasures of a simple family meal.++++@++++Pass the bug juice, Dad.
Give it to us, Grampa.++++@++++Bart! Forgive him, Dad. He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. But, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence.
You don't want it.++++@++++Yes, I do.
Huh uh.++++@++++It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.
He left this morning with the senior casino junket.++++@++++Casino?
Great! Put it on number twenty.++++@++++Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a...
Twenty, black.++++@++++Holy Moly! You're winning!
Beat it, boy, you're crampin' my style.++++@++++Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now.
Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody.++++@++++But you could lose everything. Come on.
Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."++++@++++You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
Okay, put it all on thirty-six. I've got a feeling about that number.++++@++++Dad, no! Gimme that.
Get your clammy paws off my money.++++@++++Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.
Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?++++@++++YES!!!
Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination.++++@++++Heads up, kids. I'm moving the seat back.
No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end.++++@++++The hell with this.
Bitchin'.++++@++++Oh no! Urg... Arrrgh. C'mon you stupid tube!!!
Roger.++++@++++OH NOOOOOO!!!!
Now Kent, you know that question is out of bounds. This interview is over.++++@++++All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?
Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response.++++@++++Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig.
Now Homer, you do have big bones.++++@++++Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone.
Hey, Homer, I found your weights.++++@++++Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer.
Hey, who's the moptop with the big schnozz?++++@++++Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr.
Oh, Homer, don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl, the Beatles were very popular and I had a crush on them.++++@++++Likely story.
Now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece.++++@++++Hello? Hello? Hello taste... where are you?
You can put a little something on top for flavor.++++@++++Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!
I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?++++@++++Do I have to do anything?
The Heavy Hands don't work unless you move, Homer.++++@++++I can't move, boy.
Yay, Mom!++++@++++Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! "Last Supper", eat your heart out!
You look mahvelous.++++@++++What a family.
Now you! Paint!++++@++++Honey, I'm home!
I'm painting his portrait, Homer.++++@++++Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?
Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.++++@++++All right, all right, who took the funny pages?
Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.++++@++++If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.
Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.++++@++++Marge.
I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.++++@++++Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.
I don't think I can.++++@++++What?! Marge, you have to.
I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.++++@++++Hello, what's this?
Yesterday, he read us "Charlotte's Web", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears.++++@++++A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest.++++@++++Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?
Hm, yeah.++++@++++Now, go get 'em.
Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her.++++@++++The Museum!
Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart.++++@++++Shut up, boy.
Pay any amount you wish, sir.++++@++++And what if I "wish" to pay zero?
Then it's up to you.++++@++++Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?
Hi, Lisa.++++@++++Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
Ewww. Gross.++++@++++Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man.
Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.++++@++++She said that?
Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she...++++@++++But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, "Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- "
Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.++++@++++Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.
I am giving her an A.++++@++++Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
Mr. Simpson, she did earn it.++++@++++You are smooth. I'll give you that.
